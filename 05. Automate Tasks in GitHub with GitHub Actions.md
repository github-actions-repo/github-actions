# Automate Tasks in GitHub with GitHub Actions

In this chapter, we will focus on learning how to automate common tasks in GitHub with GitHub Actions using GitHub Issues. This is often called **IssueOps**. In this chapter, we‚Äôll create a simple solution that allows you to manage repositories. This does not make sense for a personal account, but the solution should be easily adaptable for an enterprise context in which governance of repositories ‚Äì such as naming conventions and permissions ‚Äì is an important topic. The chapter contains the following recipes:

> * Creating an issue template
> * Using the GitHub CLI and GITHUB_TOKEN to access resources
> * Using environments for approvals and checks
> * Reusable workflows and composite actions

---

## Technical requirements

If you want to follow along with all the details, you will need a GitHub organization. You can create one in GitHub for free. You can also just use your personal account ‚Äì it will work the same, but it is less of a real-world scenario. You can author the workflows in Visual Studio Code or in the browser ‚Äì whatever feels right for you.

---

## Creating an issue template

In this recipe, you will create a simple issue template that you can later extend to gather user input for your IssueOps workflows.

### Getting ready...

We‚Äôll add the issue template to the repository that you have used in previous chapters. You can clone the repository locally and work in Visual Studio Code or you can do this part in the browser ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt matter. You can follow the examples in my repository (https://github.com/wulfland/GitHubActionsCookbook).

### How to do it...

Create a new file called .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/repo_request.yml in the repository. GitHub will automatically treat the file in the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder as an issue template as long as it is a YAML or Markdown file.
Add a name and description for the template:

```yml
name: 'üóíÔ∏è Repository Request'
description: 'Request a new repository.'
```

Prefill the title of the new issue with a default value:

```yml
title: 'üóíÔ∏è Repository Request: '
```

Apply one or multiple labels to the new issue:

```yml
labels:
  - 'repo-request'
  - 'issue-ops'
```

Note that these labels must exist in the repository. Create them, in case they are not available (use gh label list to check):

```sh
gh label create repo-request
gh label create issue-ops
```

You can also provide a description or an explicit color string if you want:

```sh
gh label create repo-request -c=#D541D0 -d="Request a new repository"
```

Assign the issue to one or more users or teams. Just use your GitHub handle in this case:

```yml
assignees:
  - wulfland
```

You can automatically assign a new issue to a GitHub project. The syntax is {owner}/{project id}:

```yml
projects: 'wulfland/19'
```

Note that the person who creates the issue needs `write` access to that project.

If you don‚Äôt have a project, then just create a new one. Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select **New project** (see *Figure 5.1*).

Figure 5.1 ‚Äì Creating a new project

Pick a template for the project or start from scratch. For a simple project to manage repository requests, you can just start with a simple Board (see Figure 5.2).

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_05_2.jpg)<br>
Figure 5.2 ‚Äì Pick a template or start from scratch

Give the project a name ‚Äì i.e., Repository Requests, and click Create project. Get the project ID from the URL of the project: https://github.com/users/{owner}/projects/{id}.

In the body of the form, you can define different fields. Start with a simple text input for the name of the repository that gets requested. You can make fields required and add additional labels, default values, or placeholders:

```yml
body:
  - type: input
    id: name
    attributes:
      label: 'Name'
      description: 'Name of the repository in lower-case and kebab casing.'
      placeholder: 'your-name-kebab'
    validations:
      required: true
```

Normally, you‚Äôll have a department, region, or team that you would pick for permissions or naming conventions. Add a simple dropdown with two sample departments to pick from:

```yml
  - type: dropdown
    id: department
    attributes:
      label: 'Department'
      description: 'Pick your department. It will be used as a prefix for the repository name.'
      multiple: false
      options:
        - dep1
        - dep2
      default: 0
    validations:
      required: true
```

Commit the file to your repository.
Under Issues | New issue, you can now pick your template and click Get started (see Figure 5.3).

Figure 5.3 ‚Äì Creating an issue from a template

Note that the labels, projects, and assignees are set automatically, and the controls are rendered as required fields and set with the correct defaults (see Figure 5.4).

Fill out the form and save the new issue.

### How it works...

Issue and pull request templates are a powerful tool to guide users when creating issues or pull requests. You can generate templates through the UI to make them more discoverable (see https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms). The templates can be pure Markdown, but with the new custom templates we are using in this recipe, you can create rich forms with multiple form elements such as markdown, textarea, input, dropdown, and checkbox. You can also add validation and provide default values. For the complete syntax for the GitHub form schema, please refer to https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema. Note that after filling out the form, the data is added to the body of the issue or pull request as markdown. Templates only support the user at the time they create the issue or pull request. After that, it is just markdown when editing it.

### There is more...

GitHub will display all valid Markdown or YAML form templates from the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder when creating a new issue. But you can configure additional links to external systems, and you can configure whether you want to allow blank issues or force the user to pick a template (see Figure 5.5).

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_05_5.jpg)<br>
Figure 5.5 ‚Äì Configuring the template picker form

To configure the template picker, add a config.yml file to the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder. Set blank_issues_enabled to true or false and add additional links to the contact_links array:

```yml
blank_issues_enabled: false
contact_links:
  - name: üë• Discussions
    url:  https://github.com/wulfland/AccelerateDevOps/discussions/new
    about: Please use discussions for issues that are not a bug, enhancement or feature request.
```

See the documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) for more information.

Using the GitHub CLI and GITHUB_TOKEN to access resources
In this recipe, we will parse the issue from the previous chapter and interact with the issue using the GitHub CLI in the workflow.

### Getting ready...

You will need the issue template from the previous chapter. You can create the workflow either in Visual Studio Code or directly in GitHub.

### How to do it...

Create a new workflow `.github/workflows/issue-ops.yml` and name it `issue-ops`:

```yml
# Issue ops
name: issue-ops
```

Use the issues trigger for the workflow. Note that we are not using the created or edited events but rather labeled. This allows users to relabel issues when modifying the request:

```yml
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
```

Add an issue-ops job:

```yml
jobs:
  issue-ops:
```

We only want to run this job for specific labels. Add a condition like the following to the job:

```yml
if: ${{ github.event.label.name == 'repo-request' }}
```

The job can run on the latest Ubuntu image:

```yml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

To interact with the issues, the workflow needs write permissions on issues. To use the GitHub CLI, it also needs read permissions for contents:

```yml
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
```

There is an action in the marketplace that can help with parsing the body of issues created as forms. Add zentered/issue-forms-body-parser and give it an id property to later access the output:

```yml
steps:
  - name: Issue Forms Body Parser
    id: parse
    uses: zentered/issue-forms-body-parser@v2.0.0
```

Next, add our main script. Set id to access the output on the job level. Also, set the GH_TOKEN environment variable to GITHUB_TOKEN. This token will be used by the CLI to interact with the issue:

```yml
- name: Repository Request Validation
  id: repo-request
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
  run: |
```

As a first step, read the values from name and department from the output of the step with the parse ID using jq and store them in a variable. In JavaScript, we could directly access the object, but in a bash script, we have to use jq:

```yml
repo_name=$(echo '${{ steps.parse.outputs.data }}' | jq -r '.name.text')
repo_dept=$(echo '${{ steps.parse.outputs.data }}' | jq -r '.department.text')
```

Combine both variables with your final name (in our case, the department is the prefix):

```yml
repo_full_name=$repo_dept-$repo_name
```

Set the name as the output to be used in later steps or jobs:

```yml
echo "REPO_NAME=$repo_full_name" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

We are going to add some validation logic. I‚Äôll add two examples here. You can look up the rest in the workflow file: https://github.com/wulfland/GitHubActionsCookbook/blob/main/.github/workflows/issue-ops.yml.
First, set the default message and exit code. The default message consists of two parts: first, we want to mention the user who has created the issue, and then we add the message depending on the output of the validation:

```yml
mention="@${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}: "
message="Requested repository '$repo_full_name' will be sent for approval."
exitcode=0
```

Next, add a validation rule that the name cannot be empty:

```sh
# shall not be empty
if [ -z $repo_full_name ]; then
  message="Repository name is empty.";
  exitcode=1;
fi;
```

Also, add a validation that it can only use alphanumeric characters and the minus sign (if you want to use kebab casing for your names):

```sh
# shall be alphanumeric and minus only
if [[ "$repo_full_name" =~ [^\-a-zA-Z0-9] ]]; then
  message="Repository name shall be alphanumeric and minus only.";
  exitcode=1;
fi;
```

In case the validation fails, remove the label from the issue and tell the user to fix the issue and reapply the label:

```sh
if [ $exitcode -ne 0 ]; then
  gh issue edit ${{ github.event.issue.number }} \
    --remove-label repo-request
  message=$message" Please fix the issue and try again by applying the label 'repo-request' again to the issue.";
fi;
```

Finally, comment the message on the issue and fail the job in case the validation has failed:

```sh
gh issue comment ${{ github.event.issue.number }} -b "$mention $message"
exit $exitcode
```

Set the REPO_NAME output to the output set in the step. We will use this in the next job to create the actual repository:

```yml
outputs:
  REPO_NAME: ${{ steps.repo-request.outputs.REPO_NAME }}
```

Now, create a new issue using the form template. Start with an invalid name (i.e., my_repo) and see how it adds the comment to the issue (see Figure 5.6).

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_05_6.jpg)<br>
Figure 5.6 ‚Äì Interacting with the issue from the workflow

Fix the name (to i.e., my-repo) and apply the repo-request label again to the issue.

### How it works...

Let‚Äôs understand the workflow behind it.

Workflow permissions and the GITHUB_TOKEN
At the start of each workflow job, GitHub automatically creates a unique GITHUB_TOKEN that you can use in your workflow to interact with GitHub. You can use this token to authenticate in the workflow job.

You can configure the default permissions for personal accounts and for organizations and repositories ‚Äì the default is read-only. The best practice is to leave this at read-only and grant explicit permissions in workflows or jobs.

The permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN can be configured either as a top-level key, to apply to all jobs in the workflow, or within specific jobs. When you add the permissions key within a specific job, all actions and run commands within that job that use GITHUB_TOKEN gain the access rights you specify.

For each of the available scopes, you can assign one of the permissions: read, write, or none.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you specify the access for any of these scopes, all of those that are not specified are automatically set to none!

You can also set all permissions at once. The following will set all permissions to read-only:

```yml
permissions: read-all
```

The following will grant write access to all scopes:

```yml
permissions: write-all
```

The last one will set all scopes to none:

```yml
permissions: {}
```

In our example, we need permission to write to issues and the CLI needs read access to the repository:

```yml
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
```

All others will be automatically set to none.

See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs for more information on GITHUB_TOKEN and workflow permissions.

Step and job outputs
In Chapter 3, Building GitHub Actions, you learned about environment files. We use them in this recipe to set the output that we‚Äôll use in subsequent jobs. We also use them to access the data from the form parser.

The form parser is an action from the marketplace that helps us access the body of an issue that was created with an issue template. We use id to access the output:

```yml
steps:
- name: Issue Forms Body Parser
  id: parse
  uses: zentered/issue-forms-body-parser@v2.0.0
```

In JavaScript (i.e., the GitHub Script action), you could directly access the JSON objects:

```yml
console.log(data.name.text);
console.log(data.department.text);
```

In bash, you can‚Äôt directly access JSON properties like you can in JavaScript. You need to use a command-line JSON processor such as jq to parse the JSON string and access its properties:

```yml
repo_name=$(echo '${{ steps.parse.outputs.data }}' | jq -r '.name.text')
```

## Commenting on issues using the GitHub CLI

In Chapter 3, you commented on an issue using octokit and the REST API. In this recipe, we use the GitHub CLI to do this. For the CLI to work, you have to first check out the repository. You also have to set the GH_TOKEN environment variable to the workflow token on the workflow step:

```yml
env:
  GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

Using the CLI is easy ‚Äì and we leverage the fact that we can use @ plus the username to mention the user in the comment:

```yml
mention="@${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}: "
message="Requested repository '$repo_full_name' will be sent for approval."
gh issue comment ${{ github.event.issue.number }} -b "$mention $message"
```

---

## Using environments for approvals and checks

In this recipe, we are going to use environment approvals to acquire approval before creating the repository. We will also use a GitHub App to authenticate as the repository creation normally happens in the organization scope and cannot be done with `GITHUB_TOKEN`. You must either use a **GitHub App** or a **personal access token (PAT)** with the right scopes.

### Getting ready...

Make sure you have completed the previous recipe and continue in the same repository.

### How to do it...

1. In your repository, go to **Setting | Environments** and click **New environment**.
2. Name the environment `repo-creation` and click **Configure environment**.
3. Add yourself as **Required reviewer** and don‚Äôt allow administrators to bypass the rule (see *Figure 5.7*).

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_05_7.jpg)<br>
   Figure 5.7 ‚Äì Configuring the environment protection rules

4. Click **Save protection rules**.
5. The next step is to create an app to authenticate. I recommend using an organization to try this recipe ‚Äì but you could also use your personal account. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps and click **New GitHub App**.
6. Give it a unique name (i.e., `{your username}-repo-creation`) and set **Homepage URL** to the URL of your repository.
7. Under **Repository permissions**, select **Administration: Read and write, Contents: Read and write, Issues: Read and write**, and under **Organization permissions**, select **Administration: read and write**.
8. Save the app. In your newly created app, click on **Generate a private key**. The private key will be automatically downloaded.
9. Copy **App ID** from the **General** tab of the app.
10. In the app in GitHub, select **Install App** and click **Install**. Pick your organization or account, click **install**, leave **All repositories** selected, and click **Install**.
11. Go back to the environment in your repository. Add a new secret `PRIVATE_KEY` and add the content of the key file you downloaded earlier. Also, add an `APP_ID` variable with the ID of your app (see *Figure 5.8*).

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_05_8.jpg)<br>
    Figure 5.8 ‚Äì Adding variables and secrets to an environment

12. Edit your workflow file and add an additional `create-repo` job. Make the job depend on the previous job (`needs: issue-ops`) and assign it the environment that we have created earlier (`environment: repo-creation`):

    ```yml
    create-repo:
    needs: issue-ops
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: repo-creation
    ```

13. To interact with the issue using the GitHub token, set the permission for the workflow:

    ```yml
    permissions:
        issues: write
        contents: read
    ```

14. We can use global environment variables that we can use in all steps. Set `REPO_OWNER` to the organization or account in which you have installed the app. You could also save the value as a variable in the environment. Set `REPO_NAME` to the output of the previous job. `USER` and `ISSUE_NUMBER` are set to the values of the context for easy access:

    ```yml
    env:
    REPO_OWNER: ${{ vars.ORGANIZATION }}
    REPO_NAME: ${{ needs.issue-ops.outputs.REPO_NAME }}
    USER: ${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}
    ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
    ```

15. To authenticate using the app, we can use the `actions/create-github-app-token` action. Give it an ID to reference it later:

    ```yml
    steps:
      - name: Create app token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1.6.2
        id: get-workflow-token
        with:
        app-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
        private-key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
        owner: ${{ vars.ORGANIZATION }}
    ```

16. Create the repository and set the URL as an output parameter:

    ```yml
    - name: Create repository
      id: create-repo
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.get-workflow-token.outputs.token }}
      run: |
        REPO_URL=$(gh repo create $REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME --private --clone)
        echo "repo_url=$REPO_URL" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
        echo "Repositeory '$REPO_NAME' has been successully created: $REPO_URL"
    ```

17. If the operation is successful, comment on the issue to inform the user that the repository has been created:

    ```yml
    - name: Notify User
      if: ${{ success() }}
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        REPO_URL: ${{ steps.create-repo.outputs.repo_url }}
      run: |
        gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER \
        -b "@$USER: Repository '$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME' has been created successfully: $REPO_URL" \
        --repo ${{ github.event.repository.full_name }}
    ```

18. In case of an error, also inform the user by commenting on the issue:

    ```yml
    - name: Handle Exception
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
      run: |
        gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER \
        -b "@$USER: Repository '$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME' creation failed. Please contact the administrator."\
        --repo ${{ github.event.repository.full_name }}
    ```

19. Commit and push the workflow and create a new **Repository Request** issue. You will receive a notification according to your notification settings to review the workflow as you are configured as the required reviewer for the environment. The workflow looks like *Figure 5.9*.

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_05_9.jpg)<br>
    Figure 5.9 ‚Äì Using environments for manual workflow approvals

20. Click **Review deployments**, select the environment, and click **Approve and deploy** (see *Figure 5.10*).

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_05_10.jpg)<br>
    Figure 5.10 ‚Äì Approving deployment to an environment

    The workflow will create the repository and inform the user who initiated the request using comments in the issue (see *Figure 5.11*).

Check that the link works and the repository is created correctly.

### How it works...

You can assign jobs in a workflow to environments, allowing you to add protection rules and specific variables and secrets for that environment.

#### Environments

Environments are created in a repository using the web UI or the API:

```sh
curl -L \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/environments/<NAME> \
  -d '{"wait_timer":30,"prevent_self_review":false,"reviewers":[{"type":"User","id":1},{"type":"Team","id":1}],"deployment_branch_policy":{"protected_branches":false,"custom_branch_policies":true}}'
```

In most cases, you will create it using the web UI like we did in this recipe. In the workflow, the environment is referenced using its name:

```yml
jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
```

You can add an additional URL that will be displayed in the workflow:

```yml
environment:
  name: production
  url: https://writeabout.net
```

This allows you to create dynamic environments in the workflow and deploy to them. This is useful if you want to deploy every pull request to an isolated environment to test it.

You can protect environments with different protection rules:

> * **Required reviewers**: You can list up to six users or teams as required reviewers to approve workflow jobs that reference the environment. The reviewers must have at least read access to the repository. Only one of the required reviewers needs to approve the job for it to proceed.
> 
> * **Wait timer**: You can pause a workflow for a specific amount of time after the job is initially triggered. The time (in minutes) must be an integer between 0 and 43,200 (30 days). You could use the API to cancel the workflow in that time.
> 
> * **Deployment branches and tags**: Use deployment branches and tags to restrict which branches and tags can deploy to the environment. The options for deployment branches and tags for an environment are **No restricted, Protected branches only**, or **Selected branches and tags**. In the letter settings, you can add name patterns to target individual or groups of branches or tags ‚Äì such as `main` or `release/*`. Connecting environments to branch protection rules is very powerful, as you have a lot more protection rules for that ‚Äì such as enforcing code owners or deployment to specific environments.

Environments also have specific secrets and variables that allow you to use different configurations in the same workflow.

There is also **Custom deployment rules** to protect your environments. This feature is still in public beta at the time of writing this book. Custom deployment rules are basically GitHub Apps that allow you to write your own integration. This allows services such as Datadog, Honeycomb, and ServiceNow to provide automated approvals for deployments.

To learn more about environments, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment.

#### Authentication

You can do a lot with the GitHub token and workflow permissions. But especially when automating things on the organization level, you probably need to use either a PAT or a GitHub App. GitHub Apps are the recommended way as they are not tied to a user. You already learned about GitHub Apps in the previous chapter. To use GitHub Apps to authenticate in a workflow, you can use the `actions/create-github-app-token` action:

```yml
steps:
  - name: Create app token
    uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1.6.2
    id: get-workflow-token
    with:
      app-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
      private-key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

It needs the app ID and private key that we store as environment variables and secrets. The token can then be accessed using the output of the workflow step:

```yml
- name: Create repository
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.get-workflow-token.outputs.token }}
```

With this action, it is really easy to use GitHub Apps in your workflow.

### There is more...

Issues are a great way to interact with your users ‚Äì but you probably also want to store the state of your automation in another place. You could update a YAML or markdown file or call an external system. However, you can also use GitHub Projects to visualize the issues. This way, the issue represents the state over the life cycle of an automated object.

GitHub Projects is very flexible, and you can have issues and pull requests from different repositories in it. This also means it is quite complex and you will need internal IDs to reference the fields. Before adjusting your workflow, run the following command for the project you are tracking your issues at (in my case, the ID is `19` and the owner is `wulfland`):

```sh
gh project field-list <ID> --owner <OWNER> --format json | jq
```

This will give you a JSON object with all the fields in your project. Look up the IDs. For the `Status` field, you will also need the `options` ID:

```json
{
    "id": "PVTSSF_lAHOAFCCsc4AZoDtzgQZkEg",
    "name": "Status",
    "type": "ProjectV2SingleSelectField",
    "options": [
        {
            "id": "f75ad846",
            "name": "Request"
        },
        {
            "id": "e05aa0a3",
            "name": "Repository Created"
        },
        {
            "id": "98236657",
            "name": "Deleted"
        }
    ]
},
```

Store the internal IDs as variables in the environment as displayed in *Figure 5.12*.

Figure 5.12 ‚Äì Using the internal project IDs to reference fields and options

In the workflow, add an additional step and set the environment variables:

```yml
- name: Update Project
  if: ${{ success() }}
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}
    REPO_URL: ${{ steps.create-repo.outputs.repo_url }}
    PROJECTNUMBER: ${{ vars.PROJECT_ID }}
    PROJECTOWNER: ${{ vars.PROJECT_OWNER}}
```

First, you have to receive the internal project ID as this is required in subsequent commands. The normal project ID ‚Äì the number ‚Äì cannot be used in all commands:

```yml
  run: |
    project_id=$(gh project list --owner "$PROJECTOWNER" --format json | jq -r '.projects[] | select(.number=='$PROJECTNUMBER') | .id')
```

Next, get the internal issue ID:

```yml
issue_id=$(gh project item-list $PROJECTNUMBER \
  --owner "$PROJECTOWNER" \
  --format json \
  | jq -r '.items[] \
  | select(.content.number=='$ISSUE_NUMBER') | .id')
```

Now, you can update the fields to the values from the workflow. Set the status of the item to the `created` option:

```sh
gh project item-edit \
  --id $issue_id \
  --field-id ${{ vars.RPOJECT_STATUS_FIELD_ID }} \
  --single-select-option-id ${{ vars.PROJECT_REPO_CREATED_OPTION_ID }} \
  --project-id $project_id
```

Set the URL of the repository created to the URL field:

```sh
gh project item-edit \
  --id $issue_id \
  --field-id ${{ vars.PROJECT_URL_FIELD_ID }} \
  --text $REPO_URL \
  --project-id $project_id
```

And, set the created date field to the current date:

```sh
gh project item-edit --id $issue_id \
  --field-id ${{ vars.PROJECT_CREATED_FIELD_ID }} \
  --date $(date +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --project-id $project_id
```

You can now track the status of your repository requests in Projects (*Figure 5.13*).

The metadata is also visible on a card in each individual issue (see *Figure 5.14*).

GitHub Projects is great for tracking the status of issues, but it is not so easy to automate it using the GraphQL API or the CLI. However, if you want to do more with IssueOps, it is definitely something you want to invest in.

## Reusable workflows and composite actions

If you start automating with IssueOps, workflows get very complex very fast. You will end up with a lot of `if` clauses on jobs and steps. To keep these solutions maintainable, you can use composite actions or reusable workflows to not only reuse functionality but also break down complex workflows into smaller parts.

We have already covered composite actions in previous chapters. In this recipe, we will use a reusable workflow to add the delete functionality to our IssueOps solution.

### Getting ready...

Make sure you have completed the previous recipes in this chapter.

### How to do it...

1. Create a new `delete-repo.yml` workflow file.

2. As the trigger, we use the `workflow_call` trigger. This indicates that the workflow is a reusable workflow. Define inputs needed by our workflow:

    ```yml
    on:
      workflow_call:
        inputs:
        REPO_NAME:
            description: 'Repository name'
            required: true
            type: string
        ISSUE_USER:
            description: 'User who created the issue'
            required: true
            type: string
        ISSUE_NUMBER:
            description: 'Issue number'
            required: true
            type: number
    ```

3. A reusable workflow is just a normal workflow that can have one or multiple jobs that are also associated with an environment:

    ```yml
    jobs:
      delete:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        environment: repo-cleanup
        steps:
    ```

    You can create a new environment for the deletion of the repository and add `PRIVATE_KEY`, `APP_ID`, `ORGANIZATION`, `PROJECT_OWNER`, and `REPO_OWNER`. Or, you can just reuse the `repo-creation` environment for simplicity.

4. Get the token from the app to authenticate, as we did in the `issue-ops` workflow:

    ```yml
    - name: Create app token
      uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1.6.2
      id: get-workflow-token
      with:
        app-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
        private-key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
        owner: ${{ vars.ORGANIZATION }}
    ```

5. Next, delete the repository using the token provided:

    ```yml
    - name: Delete repository
      id: delete-repo
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.get-workflow-token.outputs.token }}
        REPO_NAME: ${{ inputs.REPO_NAME }}
        REPO_OWNER: ${{ vars.REPO_OWNER }}
      run: |
        gh repo delete $REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME --yes
        echo "Repositeory '$REPO_NAME' has been successully deleted."
    ```

6. Notify the user and close the issue:

    ```yml
    - name: Notify User
      if: ${{ success() }}
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ inputs.ISSUE_NUMBER }}
        ISSUE_USER: ${{ inputs.ISSUE_USER }}
        REPO_NAME: ${{ inputs.REPO_NAME }}
        REPO_OWNER: ${{ vars.REPO_OWNER }}
      run: |
        gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER \
        -b "@$ISSUE_USER: Repository '$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME' has been deleted successfully." \
        --repo ${{ github.event.repository.full_name }}
        gh issue close $ISSUE_NUMBER \
        --repo ${{ github.event.repository.full_name }}
    ```

7. In the case of a failure, also notify the user:

    ```yml
    - name: Handle Exception
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ inputs.ISSUE_NUMBER }}
        ISSUE_USER: ${{ inputs.ISSUE_USER }}
      run: |
        gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER \
        -b "@$ISSUE_USER: Repository '$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME' deletion failed. Please contact the administrator." \
        --repo ${{ github.event.repository.full_name }}
    ```

8. To use this workflow, we create a new workflow file called `handle-issue.yml`. We have it run on labeled issues and grant it write access to issues:

    ```yml
    name: Handle Issue
    on:
      issues:
        types: [labeled]
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
    ```

9. To parse the issue, we add a common job that uses the same logic we used in the `issue-ops` workflow (just copy it over until we set the output variable):

    ```yml
    jobs:
      parse-issue:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          outputs:
            REPO_NAME: ${{ steps.repo-request.outputs.REPO_NAME }}
          steps:
            - name: Issue Forms Body Parser
              id: parse
              uses: zentered/issue-forms-body-parser@v2.0.0
            - name: Repository Request Validation
              id: repo-request
              env:
                GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
              run: |
                repo_name=$(echo '${{ steps.parse.outputs.data }}' | jq -r '.name.text')
                repo_dept=$(echo '${{ steps.parse.outputs.data }}' | jq -r '.department.text')
                repo_full_name=$repo_dept-$repo_name
                echo "REPO_NAME=$repo_full_name" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
    ```

10. Then, we add the job that will call the other workflow file. Conditionally execute the job when the applied label is `delete-repo`. Pass in the repository name together with the other parameters using the `with` section:

    ```yml
    repo-deletion:
      name: "Delete a repository"
      if: github.event.label.name == 'delete-repo'
      uses: ./.github/workflows/delete-repo.yml
      needs: parse-issue
      with:
        REPO_NAME: ${{ needs.parse-issue.outputs.REPO_NAME }}
        ISSUE_USER: ${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}
        ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
      secrets: inherit
    ```

    With `secrets: inherit`, you can allow access to all secrets of the parent workflow without having to specify them all as `secret` parameters.

11. Commit and push your files and apply the `delete-issue` label to the issue that you had used to test the creation of the repositories. Approve the deployment and the repository will be deleted.
Note how jobs from reusable workflows are nested in the workflow jobs section and how they are displayed in the designer (see *Figure 5.15*).

    Figure 5.15 ‚Äì Nested jobs from reusable workflows

Also, note that the issue was closed after the comment that the deletion was successful.

### How it works...

Reusable workflows are a great way to structure complex workflows and reuse a more complex functionality that relies on multiple jobs or environments. However, there are some limitations. You can connect up to 4 levels of workflows and you can call a maximum of 20 reusable workflows from a single workflow file. This limit includes any trees of nested reusable workflows that may be called starting from your top-level caller workflow file. Any environment variables set in an `env` context defined at the workflow level in the caller workflow are not propagated to the called workflow. Similarly, environment variables set in the `env` context, defined in the called workflow, are not accessible in the `env` context of the caller workflow. Instead, you must use outputs of the reusable workflow. To reuse variables in multiple workflows, set them at the organization, repository, or environment levels and reference them using the `vars` context.

To learn more about reusable workflows, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows.

Note that I did not update the project fields after the deletion of the repository. GitHub Projects also supports workflows that can be used to update a field if the issue is closed.

Just navigate in your project to **Workflows**, enable **Item closed**, and set the value of the status field to the desired value (see *Figure 5.16*).

Figure 5.16 ‚Äì Configuring workflows in GitHub Projects

This will automatically set the status to `Deleted` in our case when the issue is closed.

### There is more...

Of course, this is only the starting point. To adopt this in a real-world scenario, you will have to extend the solution to the following:

> * The life cycle of teams
> * Granting permissions to teams
> * Setting a base configuration for the repositories
> * Providing different templates for different solution types

But the building blocks are the same.

You also have to refactor the current solution to include the creation of the repository as a reusable workflow and include it in the handle-issue workflow. I left it like this in my repository to keep the complexity of the individual steps as low as possible while providing a real-world solution.
