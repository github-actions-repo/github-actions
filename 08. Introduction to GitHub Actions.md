# Introduction to GitHub Actions

This chapter covers

* Introducing the GitHub universe
* Understanding GitHub Actions and their workflows
* Learning about the possibilities for GitHub Actions beyond CI/CD pipelines
* Understanding licenses and pricing for GitHub and GitHub Actions

[GitHub][1] is more than just a platform for hosting and sharing code. It has become the beating heart of the open source community, with millions of developers from all over the world collaborating on projects of every type and size. Founded in 2008, GitHub has since grown to host over 200 million repositories and 100 million users, with a staggering 3.5 billion contributions made in the last year alone.

And now, with GitHub Actions, developers have access to a powerful and flexible toolset for automating their workflows, from *continuous integration (CI)* and *continuous deployment (CD)* to custom automation tasks and beyond. GitHub Actions is much more than just a CI/CD tool—it’s a comprehensive automation platform that can help streamline your entire development workflow.

This book will show you how to make the most of GitHub Actions and take your development process to the next level. It is for everyone who wants to learn more about GitHub Actions—from complete beginners to already-advanced users who want to take their knowledge to the next level. You will learn how to use Actions effectively and securely, with several real-world examples showing how it can be applied in a variety of CI/CD scenarios.

## 1.1 An introduction to the GitHub universe

At the core of GitHub lies the essential component of version control, namely Git. This system has played a significant role in transforming the way software is developed and is widely considered the standard for the versioning of code—which, in this case, does not just refer to program code. It includes infrastructure, configuration, documentation, and many other types of files. Git has risen to prominence due to its remarkable flexibility, which stems from its classification as a distributed version control system rather than a central one. As a result, developers can work while disconnected from the central repository, utilizing the full functionality of the version control system, and then later synchronize changes with another repository. The efficacy of Git’s distributed architecture is attributed to its ability to store snapshots of files with changes in its database.

GitHub has extended beyond its function as a hosting platform for Git and has evolved into a comprehensive DevOps platform that supports collaborative coding through asynchronous means, such as pull requests and issues. The platform’s capabilities have expanded into six broad categories:

* Collaborative coding
* Planning and tracking
* Workflows and CI/CD
* Developer productivity
* Client applications
* Security

These categories encapsulate the key features GitHub offers, making it a versatile and comprehensive DevOps platform that supports various stages of software development.

From its inception, GitHub has prioritized a developer-centric approach, resulting in a platform that places utmost importance on webhooks and APIs. Developers can use either the REST API or the Graph API to manipulate all aspects of the GitHub platform. Authentication is also a straightforward process, and developers can use GitHub as an identity provider to access their applications. This user-friendly approach facilitates seamless integration with other tools and platforms, making GitHub a versatile option for open source projects and commercial products. GitHub’s extensive ecosystem comprises the entire open source community, boasting over 100 million users, who collaborate to expand and enrich its functionality.

So, to understand the vastness of the GitHub ecosystem, one must also consider its various integrations:

* *Planning and tracking*—In addition to issues and milestones, GitHub offers GitHub Discussions, a forum dedicated to collaboration on ideas. Furthermore, GitHub Projects is a flexible planning solution that is fully integrated with issues and pull requests, which supports nested backlogs, boards, and road maps. Additionally, GitHub integrates seamlessly with other popular planning and tracking solutions, such as Azure Boards and Jira.

* *Client applications*—GitHub provides a fully featured code editor that can be accessed directly in the browser. It also offers mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms, enabling teams to collaborate from anywhere. Additionally, a cross-platform desktop application and an extensible command line interface (CLI) are available. GitHub also integrates smoothly with popular client applications, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Eclipse. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with popular chat platforms, such as Slack and Teams.

* *Security*—GitHub provides a comprehensive solution for ensuring software supply-chain security, which includes several key features. For example, it generates software bills of material (SBoMs) to keep track of all the components included in your software. And with its Dependabot functionality, GitHub can alert you whenever vulnerabilities are detected in any of the dependencies you’re using. Furthermore, GitHub can scan your repository to detect secrets, and it boasts a sophisticated code analysis engine called CodeQL. The platform also supports integrations with other security tools, like Snyk, Veracode, and Checkmarx, and it can be integrated into Microsoft Defender for DevOps.

* *Developer productivity*—In GitHub, developers can quickly create a customized, containerized development environment using GitHub Codespaces. This allows new developers to be productive right away. Additionally, Copilot, an AI-powered assistant, can generate code based on the context of comments or other code. This can significantly increase productivity, with reports of up to 50% gains. GitHub also offers code search, a command palette, and other features that can further enhance developer productivity.

* *Workflows and CI/CD*—In the world of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), GitHub is a popular platform with widespread support from most CI/CD tools on the market. Furthermore, GitHub provides a secure integration with all the major cloud providers for CI/CD workflows using Open ID Connect (OIDC). This ensures a secure and streamlined experience for developers who rely on cloud-based services. Additionally, GitHub Packages is equipped with a robust package registry that supports a wide range of package formats, providing a powerful and versatile tool for developers to manage and distribute their code packages.

GitHub Actions serves as the automation engine for the GitHub ecosystem (see figure 1.1). It allows users to automate various tasks, with a vast library of over 18,000 actions available in the marketplace. From issue triaging to automatic documentation generation, there is a building block—called *Action*—available to address nearly any task. With GitHub Actions, users can easily and securely automate their workflows.

**Figure 1.1 The GitHub ecosystem has thousands of integrations.**

That’s why GitHub Actions is more than just CI/CD. It is an automation engine that can be used to automate any kind of manual tasks in engineering, and it is already used by millions of developers worldwide. It can be used to automate not only GitHub but the entire GitHub universe.

## 1.2 What are GitHub Actions and workflows?

GitHub Actions is both the name of the workflow engine and the name of an individual, reusable, and easily sharable workflow step within GitHub. This can lead to confusion. Workflows are composed of YAML files that are stored in a specific repository location (.github/workflows). In chapter 3, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of GitHub Action workflows and the YAML syntax. *Triggers* initiate the workflow, and one or more jobs are included in the workflow. Jobs are executed on a *workflow runner*, which can be a machine or container with an installed runner service. GitHub offers runners with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems in various machine sizes, but you can also host your own runners. In part 2 of the book, you will learn about runners and the essential security measures to consider when hosting your own runners. Jobs execute in parallel by default, but the needs property can be used to chain jobs together. This enables you to fan out your workflow and run multiple jobs in parallel while waiting for all parallel jobs to complete before proceeding.

*Environments* in GitHub Actions provide a way to protect jobs by defining protection rules, such as manual approvals, wait timers, and protected secrets. With this, you can create visual workflows that track, for example, your entire release pipeline, giving you complete control over your deployment process. Figure 1.2 shows an example of a workflow with environments and approvals.

Figure 1.2 A GitHub workflow with environments and approvals

A job is composed of one or more *steps* that are executed sequentially. A step can take the form of a command line, script, or reusable step that is easily shareable, known as a *GitHub Action*. These actions can be authored in JavaScript or TypeScript and executed in a NodeJS environment. Additionally, it is possible to run containers as Actions or create composite Actions that serve as a wrapper for one or multiple other Actions. Actions are covered in greater depth in chapter 4. Figure 1.3 provides an overview of the basic elements that make up a workflow and their syntax.

## 1.3 GitHub Actions: More than CI/CD pipelines

GitHub workflows are intended to automate various tasks. In addition to pushing code, there are numerous triggers available. A workflow can be activated when a label is added to an issue, when a pull request is opened, or when a repository is starred. The following listing provides an example workflow that applies labels to opened or edited issues based on the content of the body of the issue.

**Listing 1.1 A sample GitHub Actions workflow to triage GitHub issues**

```yml
name: Issue triage
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
 
jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Label issue
        run: |
          if (contains(github.event.issue.body, 'bug')) {
            echo '::add-labels: bug';
          } else if (contains(github.event.issue.body, 'feature')) {
            echo '::add-labels: feature';
          } else {
            echo 'Labeling issue as needs-triage';
            echo '::add-labels: needs-triage';
          }
```

This is just one example of the power of GitHub Actions.

GitHub does not automatically download or clone your repository when a workflow is executed. In many automation scenarios, the repository’s code or files may not be required, and the workflow can be completed much faster without cloning the repository. If you intend to utilize GitHub Actions for CI/CD purposes, the first step in a job should be to download the code by utilizing the `Checkout` action:

```yml
steps:
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

This action will clone your repository, allowing you to build and test your solution. In part 3 of the book, you will learn the details on how to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD in a secure and compliant way.

## 1.4 Hosting and pricing for GitHub and GitHub Actions

GitHub is hosted in data centers located in the United States. Signing up for GitHub is free and provides users with unlimited private and public repositories. While many features on GitHub are available for free on open source projects, they may not be available for private repositories. Enterprises have a variety of options for hosting GitHub (see figure 1.4).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH01_F04_Kaufmann.png)<br>
Figure 1.4 GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GitHub Connect

### 1.4.1 GitHub Enterprise Cloud

*GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)* is a software as a service (SaaS) offering from GitHub, and it is fully hosted on its cloud infrastructure in the United States. GHEC provides additional security features and supports single sign-on for users. With GHCE, users can host private and public repositories, including open source projects within their enterprise environment. GHEC guarantees a monthly uptime service-level agreement (SLA) of 99.9%, which translates to a maximum downtime of 45 minutes per month.

### 1.4.2 GitHub Enterprise Server

The *GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)* is a system that can be hosted anywhere, either in a private data center or in a cloud environment like Azure, AWS, or GCP. Using GitHub Connect, it is possible to connect to GitHub.com, which enables the sharing of licenses and the use of open source on the server.

GHES is based on the same source as GHEC, which means all features eventually, usually within a few months, become available on the server. However, some features provided in the cloud must be managed independently on GHES. For instance, runners in GitHub Actions require self-hosted solutions, whereas the cloud provides GitHub-hosted runners.

Managed services that provide hosting for GHES are also available, including in an Azure data center within the user’s region. This approach ensures full data residency and eliminates the need to manage the servers personally. Some managed services also include hosting for managed GitHub Actions runners.

### 1.4.3 GitHub pricing

It is important to understand the pricing model of GitHub and GitHub Actions when you start playing around with them so that you don’t accidentally burn through all your free minutes. GitHub’s pricing model is based on a monthly per-user billing system and consists of three tiers: Free, Team, and Enterprise (see figure 1.5).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH01_F05_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 1.5 Overview of GitHub pricing triers**

Public repositories, and therefore open source projects, are entirely free of charge and offer many features, such as Actions, Packages, and various security features. Private repositories are also free but with limited functionality, including 2,000 Action minutes and 500 MB of storage per month.

A team license is required to collaborate on private repositories with advanced features, such as protected branches, CODEOWNERS, and enhanced pull request features. This license also includes access to Codespaces, although this feature requires a separate payment. Additionally, the team tier provides 3,000 free Action minutes per month and 2 GB of monthly storage for packages.

Free and Team tiers are only available on GitHub.com. If users require GitHub Enterprise Cloud or Server, the GitHub enterprise license must be purchased. This license includes all enterprise features, such as single sign-on, user management, auditing, and policies, along with 50,000 Actions minutes and 50 GB of storage for packages per month. It also allows for the purchase of additional add-ons, such as GitHub Advanced Security and premium support.

### 1.4.4 GitHub Actions pricing

Hosted runners are provided for free to users with public repositories. The amount of storage and monthly build minutes available to users depends on their GitHub edition, as shown in table 1.1.

Table 1.1 Included storage and minutes for the different GitHub editions

| **GitHub edition**            | **Storage** | **Minutes** | **Maximum concurrent jobs** |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| GitHub Free                   | 500 MB      | 2,000       | 20 (5 for macOS)            |
| GitHub Pro                    | 1 GB        | 3,000       | 40 (5 for macOS)            |
| GitHub Free for organizations | 500 MB      | 2,000       | 20 (5 for macOS)            |
| GitHub Team                   | 2 GB        | 3,000       | 60 (5 for macOS)            |
| GitHub Enterprise Cloud       | 50 GB       | 50,000      | 180 (50 for macOS)          |

If you have purchased GitHub Enterprise through your Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, it is possible to link your Azure subscription ID to your GitHub Enterprise account. This will allow you to use Azure Billing to pay for additional GitHub Actions usage beyond what is already included in your GitHub edition.

It is important to note that jobs running on Windows and macOS runners consume more build minutes than those running on Linux. Windows consumes build minutes at a 2× rate, and macOS consumes build minutes at a 10× rate, meaning that using 1,000 Windows minutes would use up 2,000 of the minutes included in your account while using 1,000 macOS minutes would use up 10,000 minutes in your account. This is due to the higher cost of build minutes on these operating systems.

Users can pay for additional build minutes in addition to those included in their GitHub edition, with the following build minute costs for each operating system:

* *Linux*—$0.008
* *macOS*—$0.08
* *Windows*—$0.016

These prices are for the standard machines with two cores.

The charges for extra storage are uniform for all runners, set at $0.25 per GB. In chapter 5, you will learn how minutes and extra storage are calculated in greater detail.

If you are a customer who is billed monthly, your account is subject to a default spending limit of $0 (USD), which restricts the use of extra storage or build minutes. However, if you pay by invoice, your account is given an unrestricted spending limit by default.

If you set a spending limit above $0, any additional storage or minutes utilized beyond the included amounts in your account will be invoiced until the spending limit is reached. After setting up a spending limit, enterprise administrators will receive an email notification when 75%, 90%, and 100% of the spending limit has been reached, in addition to the default notifications for utilizing the same percentages of the included minutes in their monthly plan. You won’t incur any costs when using self-hosted runners since you provide your own computing resources.

It is important to be aware of the costs when playing around with workflows, especially if you try certain triggers. For training purposes, it is best to use public repos, where the workflows are free of charge.

## 1.5 Conclusion
