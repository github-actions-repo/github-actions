# The Workflow Runtime

In this chapter, you will learn about the different runtime options for GitHub Actions. You will learn how to use different GitHub-hosted runners and how to set up self-hosted runners.

This chapter will cover the following topics:

> * Setting up a self-hosted runner
> * Auto-scaling self-hosted runners
> * Scaling self-hosted runners with Kubernetes using **Actions Runner Controller (ARC)**
> * Runners and runner groups
> * GitHub-hosted runners
> * Setting up a large runner
> * Managing and auto-scaling ephemeral runners
> * Security for GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners

---

## Technical requirements

For this chapter, you will need Docker and Visual Studio Code, though alternatively, you can use GitHub Codespaces. For the *Scaling self-hosted runners with Kubernetes* using ARC recipe, you will need either a Kubernetes cluster or an Azure subscription with the Azure CLI to set one up. For the recipes about runner groups, you will need a paid **Team** or **Enterprise** plan for a GitHub organization.

---

## Setting up a self-hosted runner

So far, we have only used the `ubuntu-latest` label for our jobs. This runs the workflows on the latest version of a Ubuntu image hosted by GitHub. But there are also runners on macOS and Windows, with different configurations. You can host your own runners on any platform you like. In this first recipe, we will set up a self-hosted runner in a Linux Docker container. This way, it will be easy to scale it up and clean up the resources after our workflow run.

### Getting ready...

You will need Docker installed for this recipe. You will also need to know your processor architecture. If you don’t know it, just run docker info and look for Architecture:

```sh
docker info | grep Architecture
```

### How to do it...

Go to a repository on GitHub. You can create a new one or you can use the `GitHubActionsCookbook` repository, which you created in Chapter 1. Go to **Settings | Actions | Runners** (`/settings/actions/runners`) and click on **New self-hosted runner** (see *Figure 4.1*):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_1.jpg)<br>
Figure 4.1 – Self-hosted runners can be added by going to a repository’s Settings area

This will redirect you to /settings/actions/runners/new. Pick Linux for Runner image and set up the Architecture property according to your Docker environment.

Note the different scripts for each platform and processor architecture. You can copy the entire script for an installation on a VM. However, since we are in a Docker container, we will need some additional steps. Note that you can also copy individual lines (see Figure 4.2):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_2.jpg)<br>
Figure 4.2 – Script to install self-hosted runners on different platforms

Start a console in the latest version of an Ubuntu container:

```sh
docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```

Run the first line of the script. This will create a folder for the runner and change directory into it:

```sh
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
```

To download the runner binaries, we have to install curl in the container as this is not part of the normal Ubuntu image:

```sh
apt-get -y update; apt-get -y install curl
```

Now, execute the line from the script that downloads the latest runner package. Just copy and paste the line from your browser to your console:

```sh
curl -o actions-runner-{version}.tar.gz -L https://{URL}.tar.gz
```

Unzip the package using the tar command from the script:

```sh
tar xzf ./actions-runner-{version}.tar.gz
```

Install the dependencies that are needed for the runner by executing the following script:

```sh
./bin/installdependencies.sh
```

Before we can configure the runner, we have to allow it to run as root as our container runs as root per default. We can do this by setting the RUNNER_ALLOW_RUNASROOT environment variable to a non-zero value:

```sh
export RUNNER_ALLOW_RUNASROOT="1"
```

Now, we can run the configuration script. If the other steps took too long for you to execute, then you might have to refresh the page in your browser as the tokens are only valid for a short period.  and execute the line containing the token:

```sh
./config.sh --url https://github.com/{OWNER}/{REPO} --token {TOKEN}
```

Press Enter and accept all default values.

After executing the script, you can navigate back to Settings | Actions | Runners to see the newly registered runner. You will see that it is still offline since we haven’t started the runner process yet (see Figure 4.3):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_3.jpg)<br>
Figure 4.3 – A configured runner that isn’t running is shown as Offline

Start the runner using the following script:

```sh
./run.sh
```

The runner will change to being in the Idle state, which means it’s waiting for workflows to execute.

Create a simple workflow that uses the self-hosted label. The bash should be available on all platforms, so we can omit an additional label for Linux. However, you could also do this by running [self-hosted, Linux]:

```yml
name: Self-Hosted
on: [workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Output environment
        shell: bash
        run: |-
          echo "Runner Name: '${{ runner.name }}'"
          echo "Runner OS: '${{ runner.os }}'"
          echo "Runner ARCH: '${{ runner.arch }}'"
```

Execute the workflow and monitor your Docker container to see how it executes the workflow. You can repeat this step as many times as you want. So long as your container is running, it will execute all workflows with matching labels.
If you kill your container now, the runner will remain offline in GitHub. To remove it, navigate back to Settings | Actions | Runners and select Remove runner from the menu on the right-hand side of the runner (see Figure 4.4):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_4.jpg)<br>
Figure 4.4 – Removing a runner from GitHub

Run the script provided by the dialogue to remove the runner:

```sh
./config.sh remove --token {TOKEN}
```

The runner will now be gone from GitHub.

We can also configure the runner so that it only runs one job and then unregisters itself. This makes a lot of sense with containers. For this, you can just add the --ephemeral switch to the configuration step after generating a new token:

```sh
./config.sh --url {URL} --token {TOKEN} --ephemeral
```

Run the workflow again; you will see that the runner will be removed after execution.
Next, we can put everything we’ve learned into a Dockerfile (you can use the file available at https://github.com/wulfland/GitHubActionsCookbook/blob/main/SelfHostedRunner/Dockerfile). This way, we can create a reusable Docker image that will register itself, wait for a job, execute it, and then terminate every time you run it.
We inherit from ubuntu:latest for simplicity. You can easily replace this with a base image that contains all your build tools:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

Set the variables that will be used for the connection. Leave TOKEN and RUNNER_NAME empty as these values will be provided when the container starts, not during image creation. Set the correct URL, platform, and version:

```Dockerfile
ENV TOKEN=
ENV RUNNER_NAME=
ENV RUNNER_URL="https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}"
ENV GH_RUNNER_PLATFORM="linux-arm64"
ENV GH_RUNNER_VERSION="2.311.0"
ENV LABELS="self-hosted,ARM64,Linux"
ENV RUNNER_GROUP="Default"
```

Before installing the missing packages, we have to set DEBIAN_FRONTEND to noninteractive to ensure that the operating system does not prompt for user input during the Docker image build process:

```Dockerfile
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
```

To have fewer layers in the Docker image, it is best to combine the entire script into one RUN command. The script updates the package manager and all its packages and installs all dependencies, adds the docker user that the container will run under (we don’t want the container to run as root), downloads the corresponding package, unzips it, changes the owner to the docker user, and executes the installdependencies.sh script:

```sh
RUN apt-get -y update && \
  apt-get upgrade -y && \
  useradd -m docker && \
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates && \
  mkdir -p /opt/hostedtoolcache /home/docker/actions-runner && \
  curl -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v${GH_RUNNER_VERSION}/actions-runner-${GH_RUNNER_PLATFORM}-${GH_RUNNER_VERSION}.tar.gz -o /home/docker/actions-runner/actions-runner.tar.gz && \
  tar xzf /home/docker/actions-runner/actions-runner.tar.gz -C /home/docker/actions-runner && \
  chown -R docker /home/docker && \
  /home/docker/actions-runner/bin/installdependencies.sh
```

Run the container as the docker user and set the working directory to actions-runner in the home directory of that user:

```Dockerfile
USER docker
WORKDIR /home/docker/actions-runner
```

If the container will run, we must check if TOKEN and RUNNER_NAME are provided. Then, we must run the config script with all parameters – including --ephemeral – and then run the run.sh script:

```sh
CMD if [ -z "$TOKEN" ]; then echo 'TOKEN is not set'; exit 1; fi && \
  if [ -z "$RUNNER_NAME" ]; then echo 'RUNNER_NAME is not set'; exit 1; fi && \
  ./config.sh --url "${RUNNER_URL}" --token "${TOKEN}" --name "${RUNNER_NAME}" --work "_work" --labels "${LABELS}" --runnergroup "${RUNNER_GROUP}" --unattended --ephemeral && \
  ./run.sh
```

Step into the folder containing the Dockerfile and create a Docker image from the file:

```sh
docker build -t simple-ubuntu-runner .
```

Now, run as many instances of the image as you like with docker run. The -d (--detached) option will run the container in detached mode in the background. It will not block your console, but it will not receive input or display output in the terminal. The --rm option will remove the container when it exits. Pass in arguments for RUNNER_NAME and TOKEN using the -e option. Keep in mind that these names are case-sensitive!

```sh
docker run -d --rm -e RUNNER_NAME=Runner1 -e TOKEN={TOKEN} simple-ubuntu-runner
```

You will see the runners in the Settings area of your repository, as shown in Figure 4.5:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_5.jpg)<br>
Figure 4.5 – Running the same Docker image multiple times to get ephemeral runners waiting for incoming jobs

Start the workflow as many times as you have created containers to run a workflow and clean up the container after execution.

### How it works...

Let’s understand how the flow works.

#### The self-hosted runner application

A self-hosted runner is created by installing the open source runner application (https://github.com/actions/runner). The application is based on the .NET Core runtime and can run on a large number of operating systems and processor architectures. It can run on *macOS 11* (Big Sur) or later, *Windows* (7 to 10 and Server 2012 R2 to 20222), and many Linux distributions (Red Hat Enterprise 7 or later, Fedora 29 or later, Ubuntu 16.04 or later, and many more). It can also run on x64, ARM64, and ARM32. For an up-to-date list of supported operating systems, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#supported-architectures-and-operating-systems-for-self-hosted-runners. You can use the `bin/installdependencies.sh` script in the runner applications folder to install all the required libraries for the .NET Core runtime.

If you want to run Docker-based actions, you must use a Linux image. Windows and macOS are not supported for running Docker-based actions!

#### Authentication to GitHub

Connecting the runner to GitHub is done using a **configuration token** that can be generated by a user through the GitHub UI. The token is only valid for 1 hour and you can only use the token to install runners. You can also create an installation token through the REST API on demand by sending a `POST` request to `https://api.github.com/repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/actions/runners/registration-token` (or `https://api.github.com/orgs/{ORG}/actions/runners/registration-token` for runners at the organization level).

Here’s an example of how you would receive a token using a **personal access token (PAT)**:

```sh
curl -L \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-PAT " \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/actions/runners/registration-token
```

The result also contains the expiration date. If you want to use the token in a variable, pipe the result to jq, like this:

```sh
TOKEN=$(<curl command> | jq .token --raw-output)
```

You must authenticate using a PAT access token with the `repo` scope to use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have administration permission for repositories and the `organization_self_hosted_runners` permission for organizations. Authenticated users must have admin access to repositories or organizations, or the `manage_runners:enterprise` scope for enterprises.

The token is only valid for registration. During the registration process, a **JWT** (**JSON Web Token** for OAuth exchange) will be received from the server that only has permission to listen to the queue. When a workflow run starts, another pre-built token with a limited scope (defined by the workflow) will be created for the life of the build. That token can’t be accessed via ad hoc scripts or untrusted code – only by the build agent and tasks. The RSA private key for the OAuth token exchange between the agent and server will be stored in a file called `.credentials_rsaparams` and the server holds the public key. Every 50 minutes, the server will send a new token to the agent that’s encrypted by the public key. The OAuth configuration is stored in the `.credentials` file:

```json
{
  "scheme": "OAuth",
  "data": {
    "clientId": "{CLIENT_ID}",
    "authorizationUrl": "https://pipelinesghubeus4.actions.githubusercontent.com/{TOKEN}/_apis/oauth2/token",
    "requireFipsCryptography": "True"
  }
}
```

#### Running the application as a service

On Windows, the configuration script will ask you if you want to execute the runner as a service so that it will start alongside the environment. On Linux, you will have to configure the service yourself using the `svc.sh` script:

```sh
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

#### Network communication

The runner application communicates with GitHub using an outgoing HTTPS connection on **port 443** using **long polling** with a 50-second timeout. This means that the application asks GitHub if any work is queued for the labels of the runner and then waits for 50 seconds for a response before the connection is closed. Immediately after closing the connection, a new connection is started. There is no need for any inbound connection from GitHub or to open any firewall ports. Only secure outbound connections using `SSL` over port `443`.

#### Updating self-hosted runners

Self-hosted runners will automatically check if there is a new version of the runner application available and update it. GitHub will only update the runner itself – the rest of the machine is managed by the customer.

#### Cleaning up

It is worth noting that the GitHub runner application will not clean up resources after a workflow run. This behavior is different from GitHub-hosted runners as they provide an ephemeral fresh environment for every workflow run. If you download your repository and perform a build, all files will just stay there. If you want to use a runner application for multiple workflow runs, then you have to clean up everything yourself. That’s why I emphasize the use of ephemeral runners in containers. This way, you always have a clean environment.

You can use workflow logic to clean up after your workflow runs – but you can also use pre- or post-job scripts to do this on the runner. To configure a pre- or post-job script, you need to save a script file in a location to which the runner has access, and then configure an environment variable with one of the following names and the full path to the script as the value:

> * `ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED`
> * `ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_COMPLETED`

As an alternative, you can store key-value pairs in a .env file inside the runner application directory.

### There’s more...

Installing the runner on macOS is the same as it is for Linux. The difference on Windows is that the script is a PowerShell script instead of a bash script. It uses `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl`, for example, but all the steps are the same. The scripts to configure and start the runner have the `.cmd` extension instead of `.sh`:

```sh
./config.cmd --url <URL> --token <TOKEN>
./run.cmd
```

If you’ve successfully installed the runner in a Linux container, then you will have no problem installing it on Windows.

## Auto-scaling self-hosted runners

In this recipe, we’ll be building on the previous recipe so that we have a solution that automatically starts a new instance of the ephemeral Docker container every time a new workflow is triggered. We’ll use a GitHub webhook for that.

### Getting ready...

Make sure you still have the `simple-ubuntu-runner` Docker image we created in the previous recipe on your machine or GitHub Codespaces.

### How to do it...

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps and click on **New GitHub App**.
2. Set **GitHub App Name** to `auto-scale-runners` and **Homepage URL** to the URL of the repository you are using (see *Figure 4.6*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_6.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.6 – Setting the name and URL for the new app

3. Skip the **Identifying and authorizing users** and **Post installation** section and proceed to **Webhook**.
4. Open another browser tab, go to https://smee.io, and click on **Start new channel**.  the **Webhook Proxy URL** value.
5. Go back to the other tab and paste the URL into the **Webhook URL** field. Set **Webhook secret** to a string that you will remember later (see *Figure 4.7*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_7.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.7 – Configuring the webhook

6. Under **Permissions | Repository permissions**, set **Actions** to **Read-only** and **Administration** to **Read and write** (see *Figure 4.8*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_8.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.8 – Configuring Repository permissions for the app

7. Under **Subscribe to events**, select **Workflow job** (see *Figure 4.9*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_9.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.9 – Subscribing to the workflow job webhook

8. Under **Where can this GitHub App be installed**, select **Only on this account** and click **Create GitHub App**.
9. In your newly created app, click on **Generate a private key**. The private key will be automatically downloaded. Move it to your repository.
10. Copy the **App ID** value from the **General** tab of the app (see *Figure 4.10*):

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_10.jpg)<br>
    Figure 4.10 – Getting the App ID value

11. In your repository, create a new file called `.env` and add variables for `APP_ID`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` with the corresponding values:

    ```ini
    APP_ID="653496"
    WEBHOOK_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET"
    PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="auto-scale-runners.2023-11-26.private-key.pem"
    ```

    We will use these environment variables in our application later to authenticate to GitHub.

12. Add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` file so that you don’t accidentally commit this:

    ```sh
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

13. In the app in GitHub, select **Install App** and click **Install** (see *Figure 4.11*):

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_11.jpg)<br>
    Figure 4.11 – Installing the app

14. In the dialogue that appears, select your repository and click **Install** (see *Figure 4.12*):

    ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_12.jpg)<br>
    Figure 4.12 – Installing the app in your repository

15. Next, we will create the server that will run when it receives a payload from the webhook. Go to your repository and initialize it:

    ```sh
    npm init –yes
    ```

    Add the dependencies we are using in the code:

    ```sh
    npm install octokit
    npm install dotenv
    npm install smee-client --save-dev
    ```

    Add the `node_modules` folder to `.gitignore`:

    ```sh
    echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
    ```

16. Create a new file called `app.js`. You can copy the content from here: https://github.com/wulfland/GitHubActionsCookbook/blob/main/SelfHostedRunner/auto-scale/app.js. However, I will still go through the code here step by step.

17. Add the necessary dependencies:

    ```js
    import dotenv from "dotenv";
    import {App} from "octokit";
    import {createNodeMiddleware} from "@octokit/webhooks";
    import fs from "fs";
    import http from "http";
    import { exec } from 'child_process';
    ```

18. Next, use the `dotenv` package to read the environment variables from the `.env` file we created earlier:

    ```js
    dotenv.config();
    const appId = process.env.APP_ID;
    const webhookSecret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;
    const privateKeyPath = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_PATH;
    ```

19. Next, load the private key from the corresponding path:

    ```js
    const privateKey = fs.readFileSync(privateKeyPath, "utf8");
    ```

20. Create a new instance of the app class from octokit:

    ```js
    const app = new App({
    appId: appId,
    privateKey: privateKey,
    webhooks: {
        secret: webhookSecret
    },
    });
    ```

    Then, register an event handler for the `workflow_job.queued` event:

    ```js
    app.webhooks.on("workflow_job.queued", handleNewQueuedJobsRequestOpened);
    ```

21. Call the GitHub API to receive a new token that can register runners. We need the token so that we can pass it to our container. We must use `workflow_job.id` to create a unique name for our runner:

    ```js
    const response = await octokit.request('POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners/registration-token', {
    owner: payload.repository.owner.login,
    repo: payload.repository.name,
    headers: {
        'X-GitHub-Api-Version': '2022-11-28'
    }
    });
    const token = response.data.token;
    const runner_name = `Runner_${payload.workflow_job.id}`;
    ```

22. Then, we must create a new instance of our Docker container and pass in the token and name:

    ```js
    exec(`docker run -d --rm -e RUNNER_NAME=${runner_name} -e TOKEN=${token} simple-ubuntu-runner`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
        return;
    }
    console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
    console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    });
    ```

    I’ve skipped the error handling part here as it isn’t relevant.

23. In the last part of the file, we must create a development server that will listen on port `3000`:

    ```js
    const port = 3000;
    const host = 'localhost';
    const path = "/api/webhook";
    const localWebhookUrl = `http://${host}:${port}${path}`;
    const middleware = createNodeMiddleware(app.webhooks, {path});
    http.createServer(middleware).listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is listening for events at: ${localWebhookUrl}`);
    console.log('Press Ctrl + C to quit.')
    });
    ```

24. In the `package.json` file, add a top-level entry called `type` and set it to `module`. Then, add a script called `server` that will run the application:

    ```json
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
    "server": "node app.js"
    },
    ```

25. We are ready! Open a new terminal and start a `smee` client with the URL of your channel (*Step 4*):

    ```sh
    npx smee -u https://smee.io/{ID} -t http://localhost:3000/api/webhook
    ```

    In a terminal in your repository, run the app:

    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```

    Start a new workflow run for the `Self-Hosted` workflow:

    ```sh
    gh workflow run Self-Hosted
    ```

    Note how your `smee` client receives the webhook that was forwarded from GitHub and how your server processes it and starts a new container that executes your workflow.

### How it works...

GitHub Apps provide you with an easy way to authenticate to GitHub and register to webhooks. In this recipe, we registered to the `workflow_job` webhook with the `queued` action type so that every time a new workflow is queued, we can start a new runner. If you have larger images that take longer to load, you could also have a pool of existing runners and still load a new one if a job gets queued. The ephemeral runner you start does not have to be the one executing your job.

As we needed an endpoint that could be reached by GitHub, we used `smee.io` as a proxy and had it forward the payload in case of an event. This is not meant for production use. It just gives us a convenient way to develop locally or in a GitHub Codespace, without the need to have a publicly available inbound port. For production use, you should host the application on a web server.

### There’s more...

This recipe intended to provide you with the basic building blocks to create your own solution for scaling self-hosted runners. Using ephemeral runners and webhooks, it is easy to automate this process. But if you need a more scalable, mature solution, then you should probably look into doing this with Kubernetes.

---

## Scaling self-hosted runners with Kubernetes using ARC

Kubernetes is very powerful but also quite complex. Be aware that in this recipe, I will only focus on getting you started when it comes to scaling self-hosted runners in Kubernetes. If you want to run and maintain a secure environment, you will need deeper Kubernetes know-how and must take on more work, depending on your needs.

ARC is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales your self-hosted runners’ workloads. It is an open source project but it is now fully supported by GitHub.

### Getting ready...

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can use that. If not, you can create a new one in Azure by running the following commands:

```sh
az group create --name AKSCluster -l westeurope
az aks create --resource-group AKSCluster \
  --name AKSCluster \
  --node-count 3 \
  --enable-addons monitoring \
  --generate-ssh-keys
az aks get-credentials --resource-group AKSCluster --name AKSCluster
```

Make sure you have cert-manager installed in the cluster (https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/). You can do this by running the following command. Make sure you replace the version number with an up-to-date version:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.2/cert-manager.yaml
```

You can check if the prerequisites have changed in the quick-start tutorial for ARC: https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md.

### How to do it...

Deploy ARC to your cluster. Make sure you change its version to an up-to-date version:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/releases/download/gha-runner-scale-set-0.10.1/actions-runner-controller.yaml
```

Create a PAT in GitHub with the repo scope. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new, select repo, set the expiration date, and click Generate token. Then, copy the token.
Now, save the token as a secret in Kubernetes:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic controller-manager \
  -n actions-runner-system \
  --from-literal=github_token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```

Create a file called runnerdeployment.yml in your repository with the following content. Replace the repository owner and name with the values for your repository:

```yml
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerDeployment
metadata:
  name: example-runnerdeploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      repository: wulfland/GitHubActionsCookbook
```

Apply RunnerDeployment to your cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f runnerdeployment.yml
```

Now, you should have one runner and two pods running:

```sh
kubectl get runners
kubectl get pods
```

Verify that you can see the runner in GitHub (settings/actions/runners). Note that the name will change after every workflow run (see *Figure 4.13*):

Run your .github/workflows/self-hosted.yml workflow from the previous recipes and inspect the output. Note that it is executed in your AKS cluster (see *Figure 4.14*):

Figure 4.14 – The self-hosted workflow is executed by ARC in the Kubernetes cluster

### How it works...

ARC runners are set up as ephemeral by default. They use Kubernetes replica sets and spin up a new container after execution automatically. ARC provides three options to scale:

> * **Scheduled**: Scale up and down based on a schedule
> * **Scale based**: The percentage of runners that are busy executing a job
> * **On-demand**: Start an instance when a new workflow job is queued

ARC supports creating runners at the enterprise, organization, and repository levels. You can authenticate at the organization and repository levels using a GitHub app or PAT. However, at the enterprise level, you *have* to use a PAT as apps cannot be scoped to an enterprise.

You can configure scale sets with different images and namespaces for different teams. This also allows you to limit networking access between them.

### There’s more...

Attacks on the software supply chain and the build process oppose a big thread. You should be very careful, especially with self-hosted runners. Never use them with public repositories that allow forking and take measures to control all the dependencies you pull on your runners so that nobody can do the following:

> * Tamper with files in your build process
> * Escape your container/sandbox or access files from outside the workflow scope
> * Compromise your dependencies by manipulating the dependency cache (cache poisoning)
> * Exfiltrate data or secrets and send data to a control server

You can use the **Harden-Runner** action from StepSecurity (https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) in your workflows. It will monitor your workflow on policies such as outbound network egress:

```yml
steps:
  - uses: step-security/harden-runner@v2.10.3
    with:
      egress-policy: audit
```

You can also use it to block traffic and only allow certain endpoints and ports:

```yml
egress-policy: block
allowed-endpoints: >
  api.nuget.org:443
  github.com:443
```

For ARC, instead of adding the Harden-Runner action to each workflow job, you can install the ARC Harden-Runner DaemonSet on your Kubernetes cluster. The DaemonSet will constantly monitor each workflow run without the need to add the action to each workflow.

You can access security insights and runtime detections under the **Runtime Security** tab in your dashboard.

Please note that this is not free software. There is a free community license for public repositories on https://github.com, but for private repositories or **GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)**, you will have to purchase a license (see https://www.stepsecurity.io/pricing).

## Runners and runner groups

At the organization and enterprise levels, access to runners is organized in runner groups. The association from workflow to runner is done by labels – but runner groups control what runners a workflow has access to.

### Getting ready...

Please note that in free organizations, there is only one runner group, called Default, that you can use to add self-hosted runners. To create multiple runner groups or use them for GitHub-hosted runners, you will need a paid Team or Enterprise plan.

### How to do it...

1. In an organization with a paid plan, navigate to **Settings | Actions | Runner groups** (`/settings/actions/runner-groups`) and click **New group**.
   
   Give the group a name. Under **Repository access**, change the selection from **All repositories** to **Selected repositories** and click the gear icon to select one or multiple repositories that will have access to the group (see *Figure 4.15*). Note that you can allow access to public repositories here but that this option is disabled by default:

   Figure 4.15 – Managing access to a group for repositories

2. Under **Workflow access**, pick **Selected workflows** and click the gear icon (see *Figure 4.16*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_16.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.16 – Limiting access to certain workflows

   Note that in the dialogue that appears, you can add multiple patterns to identify workflows (see *Figure 4.17*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_17.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.17 – Syntax for limiting access to workflow versions

   Workflows are specified with the path to the workflow file and a valid git reference. The reference can be a branch, tag, or SHA value.

3. Exit the dialogue, set the value back to **All workflows**, and click **Create group**. You can add now self-hosted runners and GitHub-hosted runners to the group. We’ll cover GitHub-hosted runners in the next recipe. Click **New self-hosted runner** (see Figure 4.18):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_18.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.18 – Adding self-hosted runners to a runner group

4. Note that the dialogue for adding runners is the same as what appeared in the *Setting up a self-hosted runner* recipe. You can test this with your container by overriding `RUNNER_URL`:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --rm -e RUNNER_NAME=Runner_Group -e TOKEN={TOKEN} -e RUNNER_URL=https://github.com/{org} simple-ubuntu-runner
   ```

   This will create the runner in the Default group! Open the runner and assign it to the new group you created (see Figure 4.19):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_19.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.19 – Assigning a runner to a runner group

Note that a runner can only be assigned to one group. To directly assign the runner to a group while setting it up, you have to pass the parameter to the config script, which is not in the instructions:

```sh
./config.sh --url $org_or_enterprise_url --token $token --runnergroup rg-runnergroup
```

Runner groups are an important feature for organizations and enterprises to manage access to runners. The feature is straightforward and does not need a lot of explaining – that’s why I’d rather keep it short and simple. In the next recipe, we will use runner groups to add larger GitHub-hosted runners.

## GitHub-hosted runners

In this last recipe of this chapter, we’ll be creating a larger GitHub-hosted runner with network isolation in the runner group.

### Getting ready...

You need the runner group you created in the previous recipe in an enterprise or organization with a paid plan!

### How to do it...

1. In the runner group you created, click **New runner | New GitHub-hosted runner** (see *Figure 4.20*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_20.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.20 – Creating new GitHub-hosted runners

2. Give the runner a name. The name must be between 1 and 100 characters, and it may only contain uppercase letters (`A-Z`) and lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), dots (`.`), dashes (`-`), and underscore (`_`). Pick a **Runner image** value (**Ubuntu** or **Windows**) and the corresponding version (see *Figure 4.21*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_21.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.21 – Configuring the name and image for the runner

3. Pick the size of the runner (see *Figure 4.22*). Note that larger runners are more expensive. See Chapter 1 for details on the pricing of larger runners:

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_22.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.22 – Picking the size for the new runner

4. You can limit the maximum number of concurrent jobs. The maximum is 500. Leave it set at the default of 50. Also, leave the runner group that was automatically set to the group in which you started creating the runner (see *Figure 4.23*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_23.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.23 – Setting job concurrency and a runner group

5. You can enable network isolation by assigning a unique and static public IP address range to the runner (see *Figure 4.24*). Hit **Create runner** to finish the process:

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_04_24.jpg)<br>
   Figure 4.24 – Enabling network isolation for runners

6. Note that provisioning takes some time. Once the runner is ready, you can inspect the IP range associated with it, at which point you will see that the label is the same as the runner’s name (see *Figure 4.25*). You can now start executing workflows on your larger runner!

   Figure 4.25 – Larger runners with network isolation

### How it works...

GitHub will provision the larger runners for you and it will assign a static public IP range if you wish. Note that you have to use the runner; if not, GitHub will shut it down after some time. Network isolation allows you to give the runner access to local resources without the need for public access.
