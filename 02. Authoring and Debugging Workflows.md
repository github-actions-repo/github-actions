# Authoring and Debugging Workflows

This chapter goes a step further and you will learn best practices for authoring workflows. This includes using Visual Studio Code, running your workflows locally, linting, working in branches, and using advanced logging and monitoring. This will be the foundation for the other chapters, as it gives you plenty of options on how to write your workflows.

This chapter covers the following:

> * Using Visual Studio Code for authoring workflows
> * Developing workflows in branches
> * Linting workflows
> * Writing messages to the log
> * Enabling debug logging
> * Running your workflows locally

Technical requirements

For this chapter, you need **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** installed on your local machine. It is available for Windows (x64, x86, and Arm64), Linux (x64, x86, and Arm64), and Mac (Intel and Apple silicon), and you can install it from the following website if you haven’t already done this: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

Additionally, check that you have an up-to-date Git version installed on your machine. You can get instructions on how to get the Git client here: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

To run your workflows locally, you will also need **Docker** installed. If you are using macOS, please be sure to follow the steps outlined in **Docker Docs** for how to install Docker Desktop for Mac (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install). If you are using Windows, please follow steps for installing **Docker Desktop** on Windows (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install). If you are using Linux, you will need to install **Docker Engine** (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).

## Using Visual Studio Code for authoring workflows

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is one of the most popular and widely used code editors in the world. It has gained significant popularity in the developer community due to its flexibility, extensive ecosystem of extensions, and strong community support.

VS Code has a high level of integration with GitHub. It offers features such as Git integration, the synchronization of your settings using your GitHub account, direct access to repositories, and the ability to create, edit, and manage GitHub Action workflows from within the editor using the extension provided by GitHub. This tight integration simplifies the workflow creation process and streamlines collaboration on GitHub action workflows.

In this recipe, we’ll install the VS Code extension for GitHub Actions and inspect what you can do with it.

### Getting ready...

Before we begin, check that your email address and name are set correctly in Git:

```sh
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```

Keep in mind that we work in public repositories. If you want to keep your email address private, use the mail address from https://github.com/settings/emails (see *Figure 2.1*):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_1.jpg)<br>
Figure 2.1 – Keep your email address private in public repositories

This email address consists of your GitHub user ID and name in the `users.noreply.github.com` domain:

```sh
git config --global user.email 5276337+wulfland@users.noreply.github.com
```

GitHub will automatically associate your commit with your account without exposing your email address.

Then, clone your repository from Chapter 1 locally. You can find the corresponding URLs in the **Code** section of your repository under **Code | Local** (see *Figure 2.2*):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_2.jpg)<br>
Figure 2.2 – Cloning your repository locally

I used SSH to authenticate, as I can manage my SSH keys in 1Password—but you can also use HTTPS and a PAT token. You can find more information on cloning repositories locally here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository.

### How to do it...

1. Open VS Code. Open the extensions window by typing *[Shift]+[Command]+[X]* or *[Ctrl]+[Shift]+[X]* or by just clicking the **Extension** icon in the left bar (see *Figure 2.3*). Search for `github actions` and install the action from GitHub with the verified badge (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions). Restart VS Code if necessary, and sign in with your GitHub account:

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_3.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.3 – Installing the GitHub Actions extension for VS Code

   The extension provides the following features:

   > * Managing workflows and monitoring workflow runs
   > * Manually triggering workflows
   > * Syntax highlighting for workflows and expressions
   > * Integrated documentation
   > * Validation and code completion
   > * Smart validation

   Smart validation is especially of great help. It supports code completion for referenced actions and reusable workflows, will parse parameters, inputs, and outputs for referenced actions, and provides validation, code completion, and inline documentation.

2. Open your locally cloned repository. There are multiple ways to do this. You could type `code .` (`.` stands for the current folder) on the command line inside the locally cloned repository folder. This will open a new instance of VS Code with the current folder open. Or use **File | Open Folder** in VS Code and select the folder in which you cloned the repository.

3. Click the GitHub Actions icon on the left side (see Figure 2.4) and inspect the **Current Branch** window. You can see all workflow runs in the current branch. Each run has the name of the workflow and the run ID with the hash. You can expand the workflow runs to see the jobs and steps. You can open the job log directly in VS Code, or you can open the step log in your browser:

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_4.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.4 – Inspecting the workflow runs in the current branch

4. The **WORKFLOWS** window shows all the workflows in the repository in the main branch. You can pin workflows to the top of the list, open the workflow file for editing, or run a trigger for the workflow if it has a `workflow_dispatch` trigger (see *Figure 2.5*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_5.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.5 – The workflow window allows you to trigger and open workflows

   Open the workflow file.

5. Next, play around with autocomplete in the workflow file. Remove the value behind `vars` in line 15. Note the extension knows all your variables and secrets (see *Figure 2.6*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_6.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.6 – Autocomplete knows all your secrets and variables

   It also has the complete workflow syntax. You can press *[Control]+[Space]* at any point in the workflow file to get a list of valid elements.

   VS Code detects problems in your workflow file and provides quick fixes for it (see *Figure 2.7*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_7.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.7 – VS Code provides quick fixes for problems

6. In the **SETTINGS** window, you can find all the environments, secrets, and variables from your repository. You cannot create new environments, but you can add secrets and variables at the environment or repository level and edit or delete them (see *Figure 2.8*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_8.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.8 – Manage environments, secrets, and variables from within VS Code

### How it works...

With the GitHub Actions Extension, VS Code is the perfect editor to write and execute workflows as you have everything in one place, you can work offline, and you have advanced syntax highlighting and auto-complete for workflows and expressions. That’s why we are going to use it in the rest of the book to write our workflows.

### There’s more...

VS Code is not just available to install locally—you can also use it directly in the browser. In any GitHub repository, just press the dot [.] key to open the current repository in VS Code directly in your browser or press *[Shift]+[>]* to open it in a new tab. To open repositories directly in VS Code, you can also navigate to `https://github.dev/<owner>/<repository>`.

In **GitHub.dev**, you can work with files and Git as you do locally: first, commit your changes and then push them to GitHub. You can install extensions and you can sync your VS Code settings using your GitHub account.

However, if you need a terminal or install some frameworks, you have to do it locally or use **GitHub Codespaces** (https://github.com/features/codespaces). Codespaces provide you with a full remote development environment running in Microsoft Azure. You have 120 hours and 15 GB storage per month for free (180 minutes and 20 GB with the GitHub Pro Plan); after that, you pay by minute and GB. A GB costs $0.07 cent per month, and the computing for the machine ranges between $0.18 per hour for a two-core machine to $2.88 per hour for a 32-core machine. For the purposes of this book, I opted for the local version so as to not burn through the free minutes, but if you have never tried Codespaces, I encourage you to do so. It’s a great way to have specialized development environments for each project you are working on.

## Developing workflows in branches

Starting in a greenfield repository, it is best to create your workflows on the `main` branch. However, if you must create the workflow in an active repository that developers are working in and you don’t want to get in their way, then it is possible to write workflows in a branch and merge them back to the main branch using a pull request.

However, some triggers might not work as expected. If you want to run your workflow manually using the `workflow_dispatch` trigger, your first action must be to merge the workflow with the trigger back to `main` or use the API to trigger the workflow. After that, you can author the workflow in a branch and select the branch when triggering the workflow through the UI.

If your workflow needs webhook triggers, such as `push`, `pull_request`, or `pull_request_target`, it might be necessary to create the workflow in a fork of the repository, depending on what you plan on doing with the triggers. This way, you can test and debug the workflow without interfering with the developers work, and once you are done, you can merge it back to the original repository.

### Getting ready...

If you still have local changes after playing around with the workflow in the previous recipe, be sure to undo all the changes to have a clean version of the repository. You can do this by executing the following command:

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD
```

You can also do this in the Git window of VS Code (see *Figure 2.9*):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_9.jpg)<br>
Figure 2.9 – Discard your local changes

### How to do it...

1. In VS Code, click main in the left bottom corner, select **+ Create new branch...** in the command palette, enter `new-workflow` as the name for the new branch, and hit *[Enter]* (see *Figure 2.10*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_10.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.10 – Creating a new branch in VS Code

   Alternatively, you can also use the following command:

   ```sh
   git switch -c new-workflow
   ```

2. Create a new workflow file in VS Code in the **EXPLORER** window. Locate and mark the `.github/workflow` folder and click the **New file...** icon. Enter `DevelopInBranch.yml` as the filename and click enter (see *Figure 2.11*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_11.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.11 – Creating a new workflow file in VS Code

   Note that VS Code automatically detects that this is a workflow file. Create a simple workflow with a `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch` trigger that outputs some context values to the console, as is shown in *Listing 2.1*:

   Listing 2.1 – Workflow created in a branch

   ```yml
   # workflow to show how to develop workflows in branches
   name: Develop in a branch

   on: [pull_request, workflow_dispatch]

   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - run: |
             echo "Workflow triggered in branch '${{ github.ref }}'."
             Echo "Workflow triggered by event '${{ github.event_name }}'."
             Echo "Workflow triggered by actor '${{ github.actor }}''."
   ```

3. Add the new file (**Stage Changes**), enter a commit message, and commit the changes (see *Figure 2.12*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_12.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.12 – Committing the new file in VS Code

   You can also use the command line if you prefer:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added a workflow file in local branch"
   ```

4. In VS Code, you can push your changes directly by clicking **Publish Branch**. From the command line, you can use the following:

   ```sh
   git push -u origin new-workflow
   ```

5. Next, we’ll create a pull request for our new branch. As we use the `pull_request` trigger, this will automatically run our new workflow. Go to your repository in the browser and navigate to **Pull requests**. Git will detect that you have pushed a new branch and will offer you the option to create a pull request (**Compare & pull request**, see *Figure 2.13*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_13.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.13 – Creating a new pull request in the browser

   Just leave the default title (the commit message you added earlier) and click **Create pull request** (see *Figure 2.14*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_14.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.14 – Creating a pull request with title and description

   You can also create the pull request using the GitHub CLI:

   ```sh
   gh pr create --fill
   ```

   The GitHub CLI

   We will use the GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com/) a lot throughout the book. It is available for all platforms and with a lot of package managers (Homebrew, WinGet, RPM, and many more). See https://github.com/cli/cli#installation for more installation instructions. After installation, you have to authenticate using `gh auth login` (see https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login).

6. Open your pull request and note that it has executed the workflow as a check automatically (see *Figure 2.15*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_15.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.15 – The workflow will automatically run because of the pull_request trigger

   You can also see the workflow in the **Actions** tab, but you cannot run the workflow manually. Even with the `workflow_dispatch` trigger, the button to run the workflow will only be available if you merge the workflow with that trigger to `main` once. After that, you will also be able to run it manually on your branch.

   You can run the workflow in VS Code, though. Open the **GitHub Actions** extension and refresh the **Workflows** window if necessary by using the refresh icon in the top right corner. You should now see the new workflow, and you can trigger it manually using the arrow button (see *Figure 2.16*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_16.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.16 – Run the workflow manually in VS Code

### How it works...

There are some limitations when it comes to some triggers, but in general, it works really well to develop your workflows in a separate branch and collaborate on the changes using pull requests.

### There’s more...

To take this one step further, we’ll add a linter to the workflow that will be able to spot errors, security issues, and missing best practices in all workflows in your repository.

---

## Linting workflows

In this recipe, we’ll add a linting action that will check the workflow and give feedback directly in the pull request.

### Getting ready...

Open the workflow file in the branch that you have for the open pull request. Do not merge the changes yet.

### How to do it...

1. Go to the marketplace and search for the `actionlint`. The action we are looking for is from `devops-actions`. The action needs to access the workflow files, meaning you have to check out the repository using the checkout action first. Add the following two steps to the end of the job:

   ```yml
   - uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.0
   - uses: devops-actions/actionlint@v0.1.2
   ```

2. As we want the action to annotate errors in pull requests, we have to give the workflow write access to pull requests. I’ll explain later how this works. For now, just add a section permissions to the job like this:

   ```yml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         contents: read
         pull-requests: write
   ```

3. Commit the changes to the branch `new-workflow` and push them to the remote. This will trigger the build, and the workflow should complete without errors.

4. To test the linting process, we are going to add some malicious code. If you use user-controlled input in a run event, such as the title of a pull request, attackers might be able to exploit this by injecting a script in the title. This is especially critical if you have a public repository and people can create pull requests from forks. Let’s assume you output the title of a pull request using echo:

   ```yml
     - run: echo "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
   ```

   Creating a pull request with the title `"Hi";ls $GITHUB_WORKSPACE;echo "-"` would execute the following command:

   ```sh
   echo "Hi";ls $GITHUB_WORKSPACE;echo "-"
   ```

   The script `ls $GITHUB_WORKSPACE` will be executed without errors, and from there, you can find other ways to inject more harmful script.

   Add the following line to the steps in the job:

   ```yml
   steps:
     - run: echo "PR title is '${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}'."
   ```

5. Commit the changes to the branch `new-workflow` and push them to the remote. This time, the workflow should fail, and the checks of the pull request show an error, as is shown in *Figure 2.17*:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_17.jpg)<br>
Figure 2.17 – Linting can fail a pull request if there are potential script attacks in your workflow

6. In the pull request, navigate to **Files changes**. Note that the linting action has annotated the pull request at the correct line number that contains the potential script injection attack (see *Figure 2.18*):

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_18.jpg)<br>
Figure 2.18 – Pull request annotations in workflow files

### How it works...

The action `devops-actions/actionlint` (https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rhysd-actionlint) is a wrapper for `@rhysd` (this is the GitHub user) `actionlint` container (see https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint). You can run `actionlint` locally or on the web. It has a ton of checks that it performs on a workflow (see https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/main/docs/checks.md for a complete list). The action is a wrapper that runs action lint against all workflows found in your repository. Therefore, you have to check out the repository first. The action then uses **Problem matchers** (see https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/problem-matchers.md) to annotate your workflows in pull requests. Problem matchers use regular expression patterns to read findings from a result file and annotate your pull requests with them. They are activated and deactivated by the workflow commands `add-matcher` and `remove-matcher`. Workflow commands can be used in workflow steps and actions to communicate with the workflow and the runner machine. They can be used to write messages to the workflow log, pass values to other steps or actions, set environment variables, or write debug messages.

Workflow commands use the `echo` command with a specific format:

```yml
echo "::workflow-command param1={data},param2={data}::{command value}"
```

If you are using JavaScript, the toolkit (https://github.com/actions/toolkit) provides a lot of wrappers that can be used instead of using echo to write to standard output. In the subsequent sections, you will learn some examples of useful workflow commands to write to the workflow log and to annotate files.

The problem matchers are added using the following workflow command:

```yml
echo "::add-matcher::$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/actionlint-matcher.json"
```

The command takes the path to the results file. You could disable matching using `remove-matcher` and passing in the owner:

```yml
echo "::remove-matcher owner= actionlint::"
```

To access the pull request, the workflow uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is a special token that is automatically created by GitHub and can be accessed through the `github` context (`github.token`) or the secrets context (`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`). The token can be accessed by a GitHub Action, even if the workflow does not provide it as an input or environment variable. The token can be used to authenticate the workflow when accessing GitHub resources. The default permissions can be set to permissive (read and write) or restricted (read-only), but the permissions can be adjusted in the workflow. You can see the workflow permissions in the workflow log under **Set up job | GITHUB_TOKEN Permissions**. It is best practice to always explicitly set the permissions your workflow needs. All other permissions will be set to `none` automatically. The permissions can be set for an individual job or the entire workflow.

In our case, we gave the workflow job permission to read content and write to pull requests:

```yml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

### There’s more...

In this recipe, we added the workflow linter as a check for the pull request by just adding the `pull_request` trigger to the workflow. However, we would still be able to merge the changes back to the `main` branch, even if the check fails. To prevent workflows with linting errors from being merged, you can enable **branch protection** (see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) or create **rulesets** (see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets). Together with **codeowners** (see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners), you can ensure that only workflows without linting errors that have been manually reviewed by a team or person are merged back to your main branch.

---

## Writing messages to the log

What problem matchers do based on existing result files can also be achieved by writing individual warning or error events to the log by also using workflow commands. In this recipe, we will add some output to our workflow and annotate our workflow file.

### Getting ready...

Make sure you still have your pull request from the previous recipe open. Just use VS Code to add additional changes, and pushing will automatically trigger the workflow.

### How to do it...

1. Open `.github/workflows/DevelopInBranch.yml` in the `new-workflow` branch in VS Code and add the following code snipped directly before the checkout action:

   ```yml
         - run: |
            echo "::debug::This is a debug message."
            echo "::notice::This is a notice message."
            echo "::warning::This is a warning message."
            echo "::error::This is an error message."
   ```

   This will write different kinds of messages to the workflow log and workflow summary.

2. Commit and push the changes. This will automatically trigger a new workflow run.

3. Open the workflow log and inspect the output. It should look like *Figure 2.19*:

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_19.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.19 – Writing messages to the workflow log

   Note that the debug message is not visible. Check the workflow summary and that it contains the messages there together with our error from the linting (the result should look like *Figure 2.20*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_20.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.20 – Workflow annotations in the summary

4. To see the debug message in action, we can rerun the workflow job with debug logging enabled. In the workflow summary, click **Re-run jobs | Re-run all jobs**, select **Enable debug logging**, and click **Re-run jobs** (as shown in *Figure 2.21*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_21.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.21 – Rerun jobs with debug logging enabled

5. Check the workflow log again and see the additional messages (as shown in *Figure 2.22*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_22.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.22 – The workflow log with debug logging on

6. However, **notice**, **warning**, and **error** can do more than just write to the log. We can use them to annotate files. Add the following snippet to the workflow:

   ```yml
   - run: |
      echo "::notice file=.github/workflows/DevelopInBranch.yml,line=19,col=11,endColumn=51::There is a debug message that is not always visible!"
      echo "::warning file=.github/workflows/DevelopInBranch.yml,line=19,endline=21::A lot of messages"
      echo "::error title=Script Injection,file=.github/workflows/DevelopInBranch.yml,line=13,col=37,endColumn=68::Potential script injection"
   ```

   This will add a notice annotation to line 19, a warning to lines 19 to 21, and an error to line 13 for columns 37 to 68. Adjust the values if your line numbers and indentations are different!

7. Commit and push the changes. Open the pull request and see the annotations within the **Files changed** tab (see *Figure 2.23*):

   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835468944/graphics/image/B21738_02_23.jpg)<br>
   Figure 2.23 – Workflow annotation in the pull request changes

### How it works...

In the same way that the matchers work, you can create warning and error messages and print them to the log. The messages will create an annotation, which can associate the message with a particular file in your repository. Optionally, your message can specify a position within the file:

```yml
::notice file={name},line={line},endLine={el},title={title}::{message}
::warning file={name},line={line},endLine={el},title={title}::{message}
::error file={name},line={line},endLine={el},title={title}::{message}
```

The parameters are the following:

> * **Title**: A custom title for the message
> * **File**: The filename that raised the error or warning
> * **Col**: Column/character number, starting at 1
> * **EndColumn**: The end column number
> * **Line**: The line number in the file starting with 1
> * **EndLine**: The end line number

The only message that cannot annotate files is the debug message. This workflow command only accepts the message as a parameter.

---

## Enabling debug logging

In the previous recipe, we saw that you can rerun failed jobs or all jobs with debug logging enabled. However, you can also enable or disable debug logging on a repository base.

### How to do it...

We can enable or disable debug logging by adding a variable called `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to our repository and setting the value to `true` or `false`. This will add a very verbose output to our workflow logs and all debug messages, and this will be displayed from all actions.

You can configure the variable using the web, the GitHub CLI, or VS Code. To set the variable using the web, in the repository, navigate to **Settings | Secrets and variables | Actions** and pick the **Variables** tab (`/settings/variables/actions`). Click **New repository variable** (which will redirect you to `/settings/variables/actions/new`), enter `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` as the name, `true` as the value, and click **Add variable**.

To set it using the CLI, just execute the following line:

```sh
gh variable set ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG --body true
```

If you want to set the variable in VS Code, just open the Actions extension, navigate to **Variables | Repository Variables**, click the **+** symbol (see *Figure 2.24*), enter `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`, and hit *[Enter]*; enter `true` and hit *[Enter]* again. In VS Code, it is also very convenient to change the variable using the update option:

Run your workflow and inspect the verbose output.

### There’s more...

You can also activate additional logs for runners by setting the variable `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` to `true`. The runner debug log will be included in the log archive from the workflow that you can download from the workflow job log. If you want to learn more about monitoring and troubleshooting, then you can refer to https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging.

## Running your workflows locally

Committing workflows every time and running them on the server can be a slow process, especially for complex workflows. In this recipe, we will learn how to run a workflow locally using act (https://github.com/nektos/act).

### Getting ready...

Act depends on Docker to run workflows. Make sure you have Docker running.

You can install act using different package managers (see https://github.com/nektos/act#installation-through-package-managers). Just pick the one that fits your environment and follow the instructions.

When running act for the first time, it will ask you to choose a Docker image to be used as the default. It will save that information to `~/.actrc`. There are different images available. There are small images available (`node:16-buster-slim`) that will only support **NodeJS** and nothing more. The big images are more than 18 GB in size. Keep that in mind. However, with today’s disk space and internet, you will get the best results by using big images. For the current workflow to run, you should pick at least the **Medium** image (see *Figure 2.25*):

### How to do it...

Open the command prompt in our current repository and see the new workflow branch. Act uses the workflow triggers to act on workflows, and it will default to `push`. As our workflow only has the `pull_request` trigger, you have to specify. With the `-l` option, act will list all workflows and jobs with the corresponding trigger in the repository. Execute the following command:

```sh
act pull_request -l
```

Inspect the workflow and the jobs. To perform a dry run, you can use the option `-n`:

```sh
act pull_request -n
```

Note that the workflow finishes successfully, as the linting of the workflow is not performed. To really execute the workflow in the container, run the following command:

```sh
act pull_request
```

The workflow will execute and fail in the linting step in the same way that it does in the pull request on the server. The result should look like *Figure 2.26*:

I think it is obvious how powerful it is to be able to run your workflows locally before pushing the changes to the server. However, depending on your workflow, the results might not be 100% reliable, and you might need to use a large Docker image that are over 20 GB in size.

### How it works...

Act uses docker containers to run your workflows locally. It reads your GitHub Actions from `.github/workflows/` and determines the set of actions that need to be run. It uses the Docker API to either pull or build the necessary images, as defined in your workflow files, and finally, it determines the execution path based on the dependencies that were defined. Once it has the execution path, it then uses the Docker API to run containers for each action based on the images prepared earlier. The environment variables and filesystem are all configured to match what GitHub provides.

If your workflow uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, then you have to provide a **personal access token (PAT)**; act will use it to communicate with GitHub:

```sh
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN=[insert personal access token]
```

You can use the GitHub CLI with `gh auth token` to automatically pass the token from the CLI to act:

```sh
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"
```

### There’s more...

The problem with act is that the images of the default GitHub-hosted runners are huge. For good local performance, it is just impossible to include all tools that are installed on these runners. For 90% of the workflows, this is also not necessary, as actions run in NodeJS or bring their own containers. However, especially with command line tools in custom scripts in `run:` steps, this is a problem.

What works great with act is using custom images for your workflow jobs. Instead of relying on the tools of the GitHub hosted runners, you can assign custom Docker images for jobs like this:

```yml
jobs:
  container-test-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: custom-image:latest
```

This way, local execution and the execution on the server are basically the same. This is also a good option if you have to keep your build environments for a longer period.
