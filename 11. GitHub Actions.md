# GitHub Actions

This chapter covers

* The types of GitHub actions
* Authoring actions
* Providing a hands-on lab: My first docker container action
* Sharing actions
* Developing advanced actions

Now that we have explored the YAML and workflow syntax in detail, this chapter will dive into the core building block of GitHub Actions—the reusable and sharable actions themselves that give the product its name.

This chapter will cover the different types of actions and offer some tips to get started writing your first actions. We will cover this in detail in a hands-on lab, which you can follow along step by step. Additionally, the chapter will cover sharing actions in the marketplace and internally as well as some advanced topics for action authors.

## 4.1 Types of actions

There are three different types of actions:

* Docker container actions
* JavaScript actions
* Composite actions

Docker container actions only run on Linux whereas JavaScript and composite actions can be used on any platforms.

All actions are defined by a file, action.yml (or action.yaml), which contains the metadata for the action. This file cannot be named differently, meaning an action must reside in its own repository or folder. The run section in the action.yml file defines what type of action it is.

### 4.1.1 Docker container actions

*Docker container actions* contain all their dependencies and are, therefore, very consistent. They allow you to develop your actions in any language—the only restriction is that it has to run on Linux. Docker container actions are slower then JavaScript actions because of the time required to retrieve or build the image and start the container.

Docker container actions can reference an image in a container registry, like Docker Hub or GitHub Packages. It can also build a Dockerfile at run time that you provide with the action files. In this case, you specify Dockerfile as the image name.

You can pass inputs of the action to the container either by specifying them as arguments to the container or setting them as environment variables. The following listing shows an example of an action.yml for a container action.

**Listing 4.1 An example action.yml file for a Docker container action**

```yml
name: 'Your name here'
description: 'Provide a description here'
author: 'Your name or organization here'
inputs:
  input_one:
    description: 'Some info passed to the container
    required: false
  input_two:
    default: 'some default value'
    description: 'Some info passed to the container'
    required: false
runs:                                                        # ❶
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'docker://ghcr.io/wulfland/container-demo:latest'
  args:                                                      # ❷
    - ${{ inputs.input_one }}
    - ${{ inputs.input_two }}
  env:                                                       # ❸
      VARIABLE1: ${{ inputs.input_one }}
      VARIABLE2: ${{ inputs.input_two }}
# ❶ runs: defines the type of action—here, this is the Docker image.
# ❷ args: you can pass in inputs as arguments to Docker when the container is created.
# ❸ env: you can pass in inputs as environment variables to be available at container run time.
```

Later in this chapter, we will provide you with a hands-on lab that allows you to create your own Docker container action as well as pass in inputs and process outputs in subsequent steps.

### 4.1.2 JavaScript actions

*JavaScript actions* run directly on the runner and are executed in NodeJS. They are faster than Docker container actions, and they support all operating systems. Normally, two NodeJS versions are supported; older versions will be deprecated at some point. This means you have to maintain your actions and update to newer versions from time to time. That is not necessary for Docker-container-based actions, as the container holds all its dependencies.

JavaScript actions support TypeScript, as TypeScript compiles to normal JavaScript code. That’s why the best practice is to develop your actions in TypeScript, enabling static typing, enhanced tooling, better readability and maintainability, and earlier error detection. Keep in mind that the action must contain all dependencies in the repository. This means you have to commit the node_modules folder and all transpiled TypeScript code. In JavaScript as well as TypeScript actions, you can use the toolkit (https://github.com/actions/toolkit) to easily access input variables, write to the workflow log, or set output variables.

If you want to start writing JavaScript actions in TypeScript, you can use this template to get started quickly: https://github.com/actions/typescript-action. The following listing shows example code for a TypeScript action running on NodeJS 16.

**Listing 4.2 An example for a TypeScript action.yml file**

```yml
name: 'Your name here'
description: 'Provide a description here'
author: 'Your name or organization here'
inputs:
  input_one:
    required: true
    description: 'input description here'
    default: 'default value if applicable'
runs:
  using: 'node16'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
```

### 4.1.3 Composite actions

The third type of actions are composite actions. They are nothing more than a wrapper for other steps or actions. You can use them to bundle together multiple run commands and actions or to provide default values for other actions to the users in your organization.

Composite actions just have steps in the runs section of the action.yml file—like you would have in a normal workflow. You can access input arguments using the inputs context and output parameters using the outputs of the step in the steps context. The following listing shows an example of a composite action and how you can process inputs and outputs.

**Listing 4.3 An example for a composite action**

```yml
name: 'Hello World'
description: 'Greet someone'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
outputs:
  random-number:
    description: "Random number"
    value: ${{ steps.random-number-generator.outputs.random-id }}
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: echo "Hello ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}."
      shell: bash
      
    - id: random-number-generator
      run: echo "random-id=$(echo $RANDOM)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      shell: bash
      
    - run: echo "Goodbye $YOU"
      shell: bash
      env:
        YOU: ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}
```

Note that if you use run: in composite actions, the shell parameter is required. In normal workflows, it is optional. Keep in mind that your action might only run on certain operating systems; the bash shell will likely be available on all of them.

## 4.2 Authoring actions

If you want to start authoring actions on your own, you first must decide what kind of action you want to use. If you already know NodeJS and TypeScript, then this is probably your natural choice. If not, you have to balance the effort of learning a new language and ecosystem with the fact that you have the toolkit in JavaScript actions and that Docker container actions are slower to start up.

Composite actions can be used to wrap recuring scenarios together. This is very useful in an enterprise context, but there are also some actions in the marketplace that do this. If you write bash scripts, composite actions are also a simple solution you might consider. If you already have a solution that runs in a container, then it is probably very easy to port it to GitHub Actions.

### 4.2.1 Getting started

Independent of the type of action you want to write, it’s best to get started with a template. You access templates for all kind of actions, including the following types, via GitHub (https://github.com/actions):

* JavaScript—https://github.com/actions/javascript-action
* TypeScript—https://github.com/actions/typescript-action
* Docker containers—https://github.com/actions/hello-world-docker-action
* Composite actions—https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact

The composite actions web page just provides an example—the others are template repositories, and you can generate a new repository directly from the template and modify the files there.

Depending on your technical background, you might have a different choice for tools and approaches. If you are familiar with GitHub Actions and REST but not with TypeScript, you might first want to try out a solution in a workflow using the actions/github-script action. This action is pre-authenticated and has a reference to the toolkit. This action allows you to quickly validate whether your solutions work, allowing you to move the code to the TypeScript action template later.

Make sure to pick a toolset and approach that fits your background and allows you to get quick feedback and iterate on your solution in short cycles.

### 4.2.2 Storing actions in GitHub

Actions are files located in GitHub. GitHub uses the action.yml file to discover actions. Since you cannot change that name, your actions must either reside in their own repository or in a folder. Storing them in folders allows you to have multiple actions in one repository. This can be better for easy discoverability in an enterprise context if you just want to publish a few composite actions. It’s also a valid solution if some actions belong together and share the same dependencies and versioning.

The downside is that you cannot publish these actions in the marketplace. If you want to publish your actions to the marketplace, you must store them in their own public repository and the action.yml must be in the root of the repository. The other downside of this approach is that you have to version all actions together if they reside in the same repository. Figure 4.1 shows a comparison of storing actions in a repo or in folders.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F01_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.1 Actions can be stored in a repository or a folder**

The recommended method is storing each action in its own repository with its own lifecycle. In an enterprise context, you can store all your actions in a separate organization. This helps with the discoverability and management.

### 4.2.3 Compatibility with GitHub Enterprise Server

When writing actions—especially if you plan to share them publicly—try to keep them compatible with GitHub Enterprise Server. Many companies still run GitHub on premises. This means you cannot hardcode any URLs to GitHub APIs. For the GitHub REST API, you can use the `GITHUB_API_URL` environment variable, and for the GitHub GraphQL API, you can use the `GITHUB_GRAPHQL_URL` environment variable. This way, you don’t have to hardcode the URL, and you stay compatible with GitHub Enterprise Server deployments.

### 4.2.4 Release management

It is important to have a proper release management for your action in place. The best practice is to use tags together with GitHub releases (see https://mng.bz/r16B) as well as sematic versioning. Using a GitHub release is required if you want to publish your action to the marketplace.

Since you will learn more about semantic versioning and how you can automate release management for GitHub Actions in chapter 8, we will not cover that topic in depth here. When you are starting to author actions, you should make sure to include the following from the beginning:

* Create a tag with a semantic version for every version of the action that you want to publish.

* Mark the version latest if you publish the action to the marketplace.

* Create a CI build that tests your action before releasing it.

* Add new tags for major versions, and then update these tags if you provide a security or bug fix. For example, if you have a version v3.0.0, also provide a version v3 and update v3 to a new commit in case you release a version v3.0.1 with an important fix.

In the following hands-on lab, you will create a basic Docker container action with a workflow that will test the action on any change to one of the files.

## 4.3 Hands-on lab: My first Docker container action

In this hands-on lab, you will create a Docker container action that uses input and output parameters. You will then create a CI build that tests the action every time a change is made to one of the files.

Tip The lab instructions outlined in the following sections of the book can also be accessed online, via GitHub: https://mng.bz/V2BP. Following along online allows lab participants to instantly copy and paste their values to the appropriate files and avoid most transcription errors associated with recording values manually.

### 4.3.1 Using the template to create a new repository

In the repository (https://mng.bz/V2BP), click Use This Template, and select Create a New Repository (see figure 4.2).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F02_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.2 Create a new repository from the template.**

Pick your GitHub username as the owner, and then enter MyActionInAction as the repository name. Make the repository public, and then click Create a Repository from Template (see figure 4.3).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F03_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.3 Creating a public repo for the action**

### 4.3.2 Creating the Dockerfile for the action

The action will use a Docker container to execute a script. We will create this Docker container using a Dockerfile. Create a new file called Dockerfile, and add the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest                      # ❶
  
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh       # ❷
  
RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh              # ❸
  
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]           # ❹
# ❶ A container image that runs your cod
# ❷ Copies entrypoint.sh from your repo to the path of the container
# ❸ Makes the script executable
# ❹ Executes /entrypoint.sh when the docker container starts up
```

Commit the file to the main branch.

The Dockerfile defines the docker container for the action. It uses the latest alpine image and copies a local script, which has not yet been created, to the container and marks it executable (`chmod +x`). The container will then execute the script. You could also use an existing image, but we want to build everything from scratch so that we know exactly what the container does.

### 4.3.3 Creating the action.yml file

GitHub identifies actions by looking for an action.yml manifest that defines the action. Create a new file called action.yml. Add the content from the following listing to the file, and then replace the `{GitHub username}` placeholder with your GitHub username.

**Listing 4.4 Writing the action.yml file that defines the action**

```yml
name: "{GitHub username}'s Action in Action"
description: 'Greets someone and returns always 42.'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:  # id of input
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
outputs:
  answer: # id of output
    description: 'The answer to everything (always 42)'
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}
```

Commit the file to the main branch.

This action file defines the action and the input and output parameters. The `runs` section is the part that defines the action type—in this case, we use `docker` together with `Dockerfile` instead of an image. We pass the input to the container as an argument (`args`).

### 4.3.4 Creating the entrypoint.sh script

The script that is executed in the container is called entrypoint.sh in our Dockerfile. Create the file, and then add the following content:

```sh
#!/bin/sh -l
  
echo "Hello $1"
echo "answer=42" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

This simple script writes `Hello` and the input `who-to-greet`, which was passed in as the first argument (`$1`) to the container, to the standard output. It also sets the output parameter to `42`. Commit the file to the main branch.

### 4.3.5 Create a workflow to test the container

The action is now ready to be used. To see it in action, we’ll create a workflow that uses it locally. Create a new file called .github/workflows/test-action.yml, and then add the content from the following listing.

**Listing 4.5 Testing an action in a local workflow**

```yml
name: Test Action
on: [push]
  
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo to use the action locally
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run my own container action
        id: my-action
        uses: ./
        with:
          who-to-greet: '@wulfland'
      
      - name: Output the answer
        run: echo "The answer is ${{ steps.my-action.outputs.answer }}"
      
      - name: Test the container
        if: ${{ steps.my-action.outputs.answer != 42 }}
        run: |
          echo "::error file=entrypoint.sh,line=4,title=Error in container::The answer was not expected"
          exit 1
```

In this workflow, we use the local version of the action (`uses: ./`), and we are required to check out the repository first, using the `checkout` action. This is unnecessary if you reference an action by a Git reference (action-owner/action-name@reference). To access the output parameters, you have to set the id property of the step. The outputs can then be accessed using the step context (step.name-of-step.outputs.name-of-output).

After committing the file, the workflow will automatically run, due to the push trigger. Inspect the output—how the container is created, how it writes the greeting to the workflow log, and how the output is passed to the next step (see figure 4.4).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F04_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.4 The output of the action in the test workflow**

The last step of the workflow will only run if the output does not have the expected value. The step will write an error message to the log and fail the workflow by returning a nonzero return value using `exit`. To test this, just set the value in entrypoint.sh to another value and commit the changes. The workflow will be triggered and fail with a message like the one displayed in figure 4.5. Make sure to reset the value again, in case you also want to try out sharing the action to the marketplace.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F05_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.5 Fail the workflow if the action returns the wrong value.**

## 4.4 Sharing actions

Actions are the core building blocks for workflows, and they are built in a way that makes them easy to reuse and share. You can share actions internally in your organization from within private repositories or in the public GitHub Marketplace.

### 4.4.1 Sharing actions in your organization

You can grant GitHub Actions access to private repositories in your organization. By default, workflows cannot access other repositories. But by granting permissions for GitHub Actions, it is easy to share actions as well as another type of building block, reusable workflows, within your organization.

Reusable workflows

Like actions, reusable workflows are building blocks that can be shared in your organization—but not in the marketplace. Reusable workflows use the `on: [workflow_call]` trigger, which you can also use to define inputs and outputs. These building blocks may contain multiple jobs executed on different runners. The calling workflow `uses` the keyword uses, instead of `runs-on`, on a job level the same way as for actions on the step level (i.e., the path in Git plus a reference or a local path if your repository is checked out). You can view the complete details in the documentation: https://mng.bz/x6XW.

Unlike composite actions, reusable workflows give you control over multiple jobs and environments that can run on different runners and have interdependencies. Composite actions, on the other hand, are always executed in one job and only give you control over the steps inside the job.

To grant access to GitHub actions and reusable workflows in a repo, navigate to Settings > Actions in the repository. In the Access section, you can grant access to repositories in your organization or enterprise (see figure 4.6). This must be configured for each repository that contains actions or reusable workflows.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F06_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.6 Allowing access to actions and reusable workflows in private repositories**

### 4.4.2 Sharing actions publicly

GitHub will automatically detect if you have an action.yml file in your repository and propose to draft a release to publish it to the marketplace (see figure 4.7). When creating a release, you will find a new Release Action section in the dialog. You must accept the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement before being able to publish a release to the marketplace (see figure 4.8).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F07_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.7 GitHub automatically detects if you have an action.yml file in the root of the repository.**

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F08_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.8 You must accept the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement before publishing a release.**

Once you have accepted the agreement, you can select the checkbox. GitHub will then check your action and provide some guidance on important properties for your action:

* Name—The name must be unique.
* Description—The action should have a description of what it does.
* Branding—The action should have an icon and a color. GitHub will give you a list of available colors and icons.
* Readme—The action should contain a README.md file.

The check looks like figure 4.9 if you try it with the action you created in the hands-on lab.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F09_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.9 GitHub will check the properties of your action.**

To add an icon and color, pick one from each list, and then add them to the action.yml file like this:

```yml
branding:
  icon: 'alert-triangle'
  color: 'orange'
```

A list of the currently available icons and colors is available on [GitHub][1].

You can now draft a release by picking a tag or creating a new one. Pick one or two categories for the marketplace that will define where the action will be listed.

Take note of the feature that automatically creates release notes for your release. It will pick up your pull requests and first-time contributors and automatically create useful release notes, like the ones shown in figure 4.10.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F10_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.10 Creating a release with release notes that will be published to the marketplace**

The result will look like the screenshot in figure 4.11. In the figure, you can see that the release contains a link to the marketplace as well as a label indicating that this is the latest release. This makes it the default in the marketplace listing.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F11_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.11 A release listed in the marketplace**

Following the link will take you to a listing that looks like figure 4.12, where you will see the README.md, versions, contributors, and links to your repository. You can also delist your action from the marketplace on this page if you want to stop sharing it. Once the action is published to the marketplace, you can also find it from within the workflow editor (see figure 4.13).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F12_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.12 The marketplace listing of the GitHub action**

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH04_F13_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 4.13 The action will be discoverable in the workflow editor**

If you want to try this out, you can modify your workflow—or create a new one in another repository—and pick the version from the marketplace the same way you would for any other action:

```yml
name: Test Action in Marketplace
on: [workflow_dispatch]           
  
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        
      - name: Run my own container action
        id: action
        uses: GitHubActionsInAction/ActionInAction@v1.2.1
        with:
          who-to-greet: '@wulfland'
      
      - name: Output the answer
        run: echo "The answer is ${{ steps.action.outputs.answer }}"
```

Be sure to delist your action again from the marketplace to avoid cluttering the marketplace with unnecessary actions you don’t intend to maintain. In the marketplace offering, you will find a Delist button in the top-right corner to do so.

## 4.5 Advanced action development

If you want to build actions, you will probably need to interact with GitHub, which offers you two different APIs:

* *REST API*—Use the REST API to create integrations, retrieve data, and automate your workflows. The REST API is easy to use because you send a simple request and get a response. And yet it is very powerful, and you can automate everything with it. See GitHub for the complete documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

* *GraphQL API*—The GitHub GraphQL API offers more precise and flexible queries than the GitHub REST API. It is better-suited for complex scenarios where you have to control the flow of data and the amount being transmitted—for example, paging big lists. However, this API is more complicated because it requires your request to specify the data and fields that should be included in the result. See GitHub for the complete documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).

An SDK called *Octokit* (https://github.com/octokit) is also supported by GitHub. Octokit is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript and TypeScript
* C# .NET
* Ruby
* Terraform

Several third-party libraries are also available, including libraries for Java, Erlang, Haskell, Python, Rust, and many others. You can find the complete list within the REST documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/libraries). SDKs are a good starting point to learn how to authenticate using the GitHub token and perform actions in GitHub from within your code.

## 4.6 Best practices

When authoring actions you want to share—publicly or within your organization—there are some best practices that you should follow:

* *Stay small and focused*. Keep the action small and focused, and adhere to the single responsibility principle—that an action should do one thing well, not many things mediocrely. To avoid this problem, try not to create “Swiss army knives” that have many inputs and can do a lot of different things.

* *Write tests and a test workflow*. Make sure you have sufficient tests for your code, and a test workflow that runs the action as an action. Good tests will give you the confidence to release frequently.

* *Use semantic versioning*. Indicate what has changed in your releases by using semantic versioning with your releases. Use multiple tags, and update the major versions with patches if you fix a bug. For example, if you release a version v3.0.0, also add a v3 tag for the current major version. If you provide a bug fix (v3.0.1), move the v3 tag to the fixed version.

* *Keep good documentation*. Make sure you have good documentation and a proper README.md that helps the users of your action understand what it does and how it is supposed to be used. Provide one or more concrete examples of how the actions should be used. Also provide documentation on how people can contribute changes.

* *Have proper action.yml metadata*. Provide good metadata in your action.yml, especially for your inputs and outputs. Try to avoid required inputs and provide default values whenever possible. This will make it much easier to consume your action.

* *Use SDKs*. Use the toolkit (github.com/actions/toolkit) or the other SDKs to interact with GitHub and the APIs.

* *Publish the action*. Last but not least, publish the action to the marketplace to make it discoverable and encourage others to to contribute to it or provide feedback.

## 4.7 Conclusion

In this chapter, you learned what actions are as well as some tips and best practices to help you start writing and sharing actions. We’ve now reached the end of part 1, and you should now have a good understanding of GitHub Actions workflows, the workflow syntax, and writing GitHub actions. In part 2, we will dive deep into how runners execute your workflows as well as their security implications before covering the more practical topic of using actions for CI/CD in part 3.

## Summary

* There are three types of GitHub Actions: Docker container actions, JavaScript actions, and composite actions.
* Docker container actions only run on Linux, not on Windows or macOS.
* Docker container actions can retrieve an image from a Docker library, like Docker Hub, or build a Dockerfile.
* JavaScript actions run directly on the runner using NodeJS and are faster than container actions.
* Composite actions are a wrapper for other steps or actions.
* You publish actions to the marketplace by placing them in their own repository and publishing a GitHub release.
* You can share actions internally by granting access to workflows in your organization in a private repository.
