# My first Actions workflow

This chapter covers

* Creating a new workflow
* Using the workflow editor
* Using actions from the marketplace
* Running the workflow

Before we dive into the details of the workflow and YAML syntax in chapter 3, itâ€™s a good idea to familiarize ourselves with the workflow editor, gain some practical experience creating a workflow, and test it out to see it in action. This hands-on approach will help us better understand the concepts and give us the ability to quickly try something out, if it is unclear. Donâ€™t worry if there are parts of the workflow syntax that you donâ€™t understand yetâ€”weâ€™ll be covering those in detail in the upcoming chapters.

## 2.1 Creating a new workflow

Begin this hands-on lab by signing into your GitHub account. Then, visit https://github.com/new to create a new repository. To ensure you have unlimited Action minutes, create a new public repository in your user profile and name it ActionsInAction. Initialize the repository with a readme so that you can retrieve the files in the workflow later on. Finally, click on the Create Repository button to complete the process (refer to figure 2.1).

The repository

You can find companion repositories in the GitHub Organization (https://github.com/GitHubActionsInAction). If you have already cloned the companion repository (https://github.com/GitHubActionsInAction/Part1), you can also create a new workflow in this repository instead of creating a new one.

Now, letâ€™s navigate to the Actions tab inside the repository. If this is a new repository and there are no workflows set up yet, you will automatically be redirected to the new Action page (Actions/New). This is the same page you would land on if you clicked the New Workflow button in the workflow overview page, which is displayed if there are workflows in the repository. The new workflow page presents a plethora of templates for different languages and scenarios. You can certainly explore these available templates, but for our first workflow, we want to create the workflow ourselves. To proceed, simply click on the corresponding link, as illustrated in figure 2.2. An empty workflow will be created and opened in the workflow editor.

**Figure 2.2 Setting up a new workflow in the workflow editor**

2.2 Using the workflow editor
Itâ€™s worth noting that a workflow is essentially a YAML file inside the .github/workflows folder. You can modify the filename as necessary from the top of the editor window. On the right side of the editor, youâ€™ll find the marketplace as well as the workflow documentation. The documentation provides valuable guidance to get you started. Moreover, the editor supports autocomplete when you use the Ctrl-Space keyboard shortcut. To give you a better idea of the key components of the editor, please refer to figure 2.3.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH02_F03_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 2.3 The workflow editor**

To begin, change the filename of the workflow file to MyFirstWorkflow.yml. Once thatâ€™s done, click into the editor and open the autocomplete by pressing Ctrl-Space. From the list of valid elements, choose Name. The autocomplete feature will automatically add name:, using the correct spacing to the file. Next, name the workflow My First Workflow and press Enter to start a new line.

Now, letâ€™s add triggers that will initiate the workflow. Begin a new line and press Ctrl-Space once again. From the options presented, select on and then push. Autocomplete will generate the following line, which will start the workflow upon any push in any branch:

```yml
on: [push]
```

Suppose you want to trigger the workflow from only certain branches. In that case, you need to add additional parameters to the push trigger. First, delete [push] and press Enter to start a new line. Use the Tab key to get the correct indentation. Next, press Ctrl-Space again, and select push. Notice how autocomplete now functions differently; it will automatically create a new line and offer all the available options for the push trigger. From there, choose branches and add the main branch, as shown in the documentation.

Create a new line with the same indentation as the push trigger and add a workflow_dispatch trigger, which will enable you to trigger the workflow manually. At this point, your workflow should resemble the one depicted in figure 2.4.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH02_F04_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 2.4 Naming the workflow and adding triggers**

To add a job to the workflow, create a new line in the workflow file with no indentation (the same way as name and on). Use autocomplete to write jobs: and move to the next line. Note that autocomplete wonâ€™t work here, as the name of the job is expected. Enter MyFirstJob:, press Enter to start a new line, and then press Tab to indent one level. Autocomplete should work again now. Choose runs-on and enter ubuntu
-latest, which will execute the job on the latest Ubuntu machine hosted by GitHub.

Next, add a step to the job. If you choose steps from autocomplete, it will insert a small snippet with a YAML array that you can use to enter your first step. For example, you can output Hello World to the console using run and echo, as shown in the following listing.

**Listing 2.1 The first step outputting Hello World to the console**

```yml
jobs:
  MyFirstJob:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - run: echo "ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!"
```

Error checking in the editor

Itâ€™s important to note that if there are errors in your workflow file, the editor will mark the corresponding parts, and you can hover over them with your mouse to get additional information and other suggestions (see figure 2.5). The editor will highlight structural errors, unexpected values, or even conflicting values, such as an invalid shell value for the chosen operating system.

In the next step, we will add a GitHub action from the marketplace.

## 2.3 Using actions from the marketplace

In the right pane, next to documentation, you can find the marketplace for GitHub Actions. To locate the Checkout action from GitHub Actions, start by typing Checkout in the search bar (see figure 2.6). Please note that the author of the action is not GitHub, but Actions, and that it has a blue badge with a checkmark, indicating that the author is a verified creator.

**Figure 2.6 Searching in the marketplace from within the editor**

If you click on the Marketplace listing, you will be taken to a page with more details about the action. You can also copy the template using the Copy button (see figure 2.7) or copy parts of the YAML code snippet provided in the Installation section. The parameters for the action are under the with: property. They are all optional, so you can delete them all or just copy over name: and uses:. Paste the action as a step to the workflow, as illustrated in figure 2.7.

**Figure 2.7 Adding the action from the marketplace to the workflow**

As a last step, add a script that displays the files in the repository, using the tree command. Use the name property to set the name that is displayed in the workflow log. In this step, we use a multiline script, using the pipe operator | and a two-blank indentation for the script. In the first line, we output the name of the repository, using an expression. We then use the tree command to output the files in the repository, as shown in the following listing.

**Listing 2.2 Running a multiline script to display all files in the repository**

```yml
- name: List files in repository
  run: |
    echo "The repository ${{ github.repository }} contains the following files:"
    tree
```

If the editor does not indicate any errors, commit the workflow to your main branch (see figure 2.8). This will automatically trigger a workflow run because of the push trigger.

## 2.4 Running the workflow

The workflow will start automatically because of the push trigger on the main branch. To observe the workflow run, navigate to the Actions tab (see figure 2.9). In the case of a push trigger, the name of the workflow run corresponds to the commit message. Additionally, you can view the branch on which the workflow was executed as well as the time and duration of the run. Clicking on the workflow run will provide you with more detailed information.

**Figure 2.9 The workflow runs in the Actions tab**

Within the workflow run overview page, you will come across a detail pane situated at the top, providing information about the trigger, status, and duration of the workflow. On the left-hand side, you will find a list displaying the jobs, while the workflow designer is located in the center (see figure 2.10). Clicking on a specific job will redirect you to the corresponding Job Details page.

**Figure 2.10 The workflow run overview**

On the Job Details page, you will discover a log that allows you to track the progress of the running workflow. Each step within the workflow has its own collapsible section for easy navigation. Additionally, you will notice a Set Up Job section, providing additional details about the runner image, operating system, installed software, and workflow permissions.

Each line in the workflow log is equipped with a deep link, enabling you to directly access a specific line within the log. In the top-right corner, you will find a Settings menu, where you can choose to display timestamps in the log or download the entire log for further analysis (see figure 2.11).

**Figure 2.11 The job details containing the workflow run log**

With the inclusion of the workflow_dispatch trigger in your workflow, you now have the ability to manually run the workflow. To initiate the workflow manually, return to the Actions tab and select the workflow from the left-hand side, as illustrated in figure 2.12. Once selected, you will encounter a Run Workflow menu that you can use to trigger the workflow. While the workflow is starting, go to the Workflow Overview page and the Job Details page to observe the workflow in real time.
