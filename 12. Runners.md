# Runners

This chapter covers

* Getting to know GitHub runners
* Understanding what the runner service does
* Using GitHub-hosted runners
* Analyzing utilization of GitHub-hosted runners
* When to use self-hosted runners

The runtime of GitHub Actions is provided by services called runners. Runners are standalone instances that continuously ask GitHub if there is work for them to execute. They provide the runtime for your job definitions; they will execute the steps defined in the job for you and provide information about the outcome back to GitHub as well as the logs and any data uploaded to GitHub—for example, artifacts and cache information.

In this chapter, we will focus on the runners GitHub hosts for you as a service. These are called GitHub-hosted runners and come with certain compute power and preinstalled software, and they are maintained with the latest security and operating system (OS) updates. Since GitHub does all the maintenance for you, there is a cost attached to using these runners. Depending on your plan, you will have a certain amount of action minutes included for free (see section 5.4).

## 5.1 Targeting a runner

Job definitions have to specify a set of labels they want to use for the GitHub service to find a match when a job is queued to be executed (see listing 5.1). A job must target at least one runner label and can target multiple labels if needed. The GitHub-hosted runners have several default labels available to indicate, for example, the operating system of the runner.

**Listing 5.1 An example of targeting multiple labels to run the job**

```yml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest, vnet1, sql]
    steps:
      run: echo 'Job is running on ${{ runner.os }}'
```

GitHub will use the list of labels to find a runner that is online and ready to handle jobs. For a job to find a runner, all labels in the runs-on array need to match.

You can also install the runner yourself, in your own environment; these are called self-hosted runners. Since you define where the service is being hosted (local machine, cloud, etc.), you are already paying for that compute. GitHub does not charge you for self-hosted runners or for parallel job executions. With self-hosted runners, you can add extra labels associated with the runner as well. One extra label is always added to the self-hosted runner so that users can differentiate it from the GitHub runners. The value of that label is self-hosted. This is available next to the label that indicates the OS and the bitness of the environment. You can find more information about self-hosted runners in chapter 6.

## 5.2 Queuing jobs

A job can be queued in many different ways; see chapter 3 for ways to trigger a job to be queued. When the event is triggered, GitHub will start queueing the relevant jobs from the workflow and will start searching for an available runner that has the correct labels (and is available for your repository). For GitHub-hosted runners, the queuing of the job will fail if there are no runners available with the requested label(s) within 45 minutes. For self-hosted runners, the job will stay queued until a matching runner comes online. The maximum duration of being queued is 24 hours. If there is no runner available within this period, the job will be terminated. The most common reason the workflow does not start is because the runner label does not exist or is not available for the current repository. This could be, for example, because the label for a self-hosted runner is used, which does not exist on GitHub-hosted runners.

## 5.3 The runner application

The runner application is based on the .NET core and can be installed on a virtual machine, a container, or any other environment that can run .NET core code. That means it can be installed on Linux, Windows, and macOS operating systems as well as on x86, x64, and ARM processors. This allows you the flexibility of hosting it where it makes sense to you, whether that is on a full-fledged server (physical or virtual) or a containerized environment. You can run it in AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Kubernetes. The application itself can be installed as a service and has configuration options to start when the environment starts, to only run on demand, or to run ephemeral. Configuring a runner as ephemeral means that the runner will only handle a single job, after which it will stop asking for more work. That gives you the opportunity to clean up after each run or to completely destroy the environment and start up new environments as needed.

The source code of the runner is open source, so you can see how it works and can even contribute issues and pull requests to make the service better. The release notes of the runner contain important information about upcoming changes, like we have seen, for example, with the planned deprecation of set-output and save-state—actions and scripts that used these calls got warnings in the months before the actual deprecation. You can look at the source code and follow along with the updates via GitHub at https://github.com/actions/runner.

The runner service will execute job definition and handles things like these:

* Downloading action repositories
* Writing the logs back to GitHub for later retrieval
* Uploading and downloading artifacts to and from GitHub
* Reading and writing to the cache service provided by GitHub

## 5.4 GitHub-hosted runners

GitHub hosts runners to allow their users to get started using GitHub Actions quickly. That means that GitHub hosts the environments that execute the runner service and makes sure the OS is secured, continuously updated, and has the latest security updates installed. Any tool they provide on the environment also needs to be updated to the latest version and include new security fixes. What is installed on the environment can be found in this public repository: https://github.com/actions/runner-images. You can find which version of the environment was used for each job execution by checking the execution logs (see figure 5.1).

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F01_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.1 Setting up job steps with information about the environment**

In the https://github.com/actions/runner-images repository, you will find the list of installed software, the versions that were used during installation, as well as any information about deprecated versions of software on the environment. An example of the information from the used environment can be found in figure 5.2.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F02_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.2 Information about the runner image**

The images are updated on a weekly basis or more often when needed. The version is linked to the date (in ISO format) of the Monday of the week the image was created and starts with version 0—for example, 20230417.0. If any extra updates are needed during the week (normally only to fix broken software deployments or security updates), they update the version number but not the date—for example, 20230417.1, 20230417.2, and so on. New versions are gradually rolled out based on the US time zone in California, as most of the engineering teams responsible are located in that time zone. In case any deployment problems arise, they can quickly mitigate the problem by, for example, stopping the rollout, reverting back to a previous version, or rolling out a fix.

## 5.5 Hosted operating systems

GitHub hosts three different operating systems for you to choose from:

* Linux based (Ubuntu)
* Windows based
* macOS based

For each operating system, GitHub usually hosts the two or three most recent versions, which can be targeted with the label for that specific version (see table 5.1). You can always find the latest version in the documentation on GitHub at: https://mng.bz/ZVxP.

**Table 5.1 Overview of supported runner operating systems**

| **Operating system** | **Version label available ** |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Ubuntu               | ubuntu-24.04                 |
|                      | ubuntu-22.04                 |
|                      | ubuntu-20.04                 |
| Windows              | windows-2022                 |
|                      | windows-2019                 |
| macOS                | macos-14                     |
|                      | macos-12                     |
|                      | macos-11                     |

Next to the version labels, there is always a latest version of each operating system available:

* ubuntu-latest
* windows-latest
* macos-latest

These labels are there for your convenience. It is up to GitHub to decide which version is latest at any given time. Any changes to the meaning of latest are communicated up front through the runner-images repository as well as deprecation warning messages in the action logs. In the past, we have seen changes to the latest version being communicated up to six months before they started to mean the new version. Right before the new version becomes latest, GitHub also flips the meaning of latest for a percentage of the runners and carefully checks their telemetry for any spikes in errors coming from the change.

## 5.6 Installed software

A lot of software comes preinstalled with the GitHub-hosted runners, including the operating systems’ built-in tools and shells. For example, Ubuntu and macOS runners include grep, find, and which, among other default tools. The software list is available in the runner-images repositories and is dependent on the operating system itself, as not everything is available for Linux, Windows, or MacOS. GitHub works together with the user community to define what software will get installed on the environment. They focus on the most-used SDKs, shells, package ecosystems, and so on. If you need software that is missing, you can create an issue in the runner-images repository and propose it for adoption. Since GitHub is then responsible for installation, maintenance, and security, it is up to them to decide if they think it is worth the effort of including the new software on the environment. See figure 5.3 for a partial listing of the installed languages.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F03_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.3 A partial list of preinstalled software on an Ubuntu runner**

It is not recommended to assume that a specific version of an SDK (or other software) is always installed on the runners by default. It’s up to GitHub to decide when a version is updated to a newer version, which could potentially break your job definition. When a version is being deprecated, GitHub announces that up front and will start generating warnings in the runner logs to urge users to start upgrading. We have seen this, for example, with the deprecation of Node 12 in favor of Node 16; large amounts of GitHub Actions were still using the older version, and a lot of jobs started to fail because of it. Usually, this means that the latest long-term support (LTS) release is supported.

When you know your job is dependent on having, for example, Node 14 installed, then specify that in the job definition itself. The following listing shows an example.

**Listing 5.2 Defining the node version needed**

```yml
steps:
  name: Install node with correct version
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: 14
  
  name: build your node application
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run build
```

There are setup actions available for widely used SDKs that are maintained by GitHub in their actions organization, including the following:

* actions/setup-dotnet
* actions/setup-java
* actions/setup-go
* actions/setup-node
* actions/setup-python

By specifying the version you need, the job will always have the right version available, which saves you time and errors when the default environment is updated to the latest LTS of that SDK. For popular versions, the last three versions are also cached on the runner image. So when the LTS version of Node on the runners is 18, versions 16 and 14 are stored in the opt/hostedtoolcache folder of the GitHub-hosted runner. The actions that can switch between versions know about this common folder and will use the version for the corresponding folder when told to do so. Switching to the correct version will not require a full download to save execution time. If the version is no longer in the hostedtoolscache directory, the setup actions will download it from the corresponding GitHub repository and install it from there.

## 5.7 Default shells

Which default shell is used for your steps in your job depends on the operating system:

* Windows—pwsh (PowerShell core)
* Linux—bash
* macOS—bash

You can always check if the OS you are using has other shells installed as well. For example, each GitHub-hosted operating system has the following already pre-installed for you:

* bash (on Windows, the bash shell included with Git for Windows is used)
* pwsh (PowerShell code)
* python

You can then specify the shell to use for each run step, as seen in the following listing.

Listing 5.3 Specifying the shell

```yml
steps:
    run: echo "Hello world"
    shell: pwsh
```

You can also make the desired shell the default for all jobs in the workflow, as shown in listing 5.4. Using that will set the default shell for any step in every job in the workflow to your value. If a single step still needs a different shell, you can use the shell keyword at the step level to override the default.

**Listing 5.4 Specifying the default shell for all jobs**

```yml
name: example-workflow
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  
defaults:
  shell: pwsh
```

## 5.8 Installing extra software

If the software you need is not installed on the runner environment, there are lots of actions available on the public marketplace that will install the software for you. Be aware of the security implications of these actions: they download binaries from somewhere (often, they download from the GitHub releases of their corresponding repositories) and start installing them on the runner. There are actions that perform the download themselves as well as actions that download and execute an installation script from a vendor (e.g., through an npm package). Verify those actions beforehand, and follow best practices for using them, like pinning their version with a commit SHA hash for the version you have checked. For more information on version pinning, see chapter 3.

## 5.9 Location and hardware specifications of the hosted runners

GitHub-hosted runners are either hosted by GitHub directly (Linux and Windows runners are hosted in Microsoft Azure) or by a third party (for macOS runners). Currently, there is no option to define in which region the runners are hosted. If you have data residency requirements, you will have to create a setup for self-hosted runners in the region of your choice.

The default Linux - and Windows-based runners are hosted on Standard_DS2_v2 in Microsoft Azure. That means they have the following specs available:

* 2-core processors (x86_64)
* 7 GB RAM
* 14 GB of hard storage

On the other hand, macOS-based runners have these specs available:

* 3-core processors (x86_64)
* 14 GB RAM
* 14 GB of hard disk storage

Next to the default runners, there are also more powerful macOS runners in case you need extra compute to speed up your jobs. This can be very helpful if you have CPU- or RAM-intensive workloads that hit the limits of the default runners. See chapter 7 for more information about finding the resources used in your runners.

The extra-large macOS runners can be targeted with the following labels: `macos-12-xl` or `macos-latest-xl`. These runners have 12-core CPUs available and the same specs as the normal macOS runners for the rest.

## 5.10 Concurrent jobs

Depending on your plan, there are some limitations on the number of jobs that can run at the same time. See table 5.2 for the different plan limits.

**Table 5.2 Overview of maximum concurrent jobs**

| **GitHub plan** | **Total concurrent jobs** | **Maximum concurrent macOS jobs** |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Free            | 20                        | 5                                 |
| Pro             | 40                        | 5                                 |
| Team            | 60                        | 5                                 |
| Enterprise      | 5,000                     | 50                                |

## 5.11 Larger GitHub-hosted runners

When the hardware specs for the normal hosted runners are not enough for your workload, you can use larger GitHub-hosted runners. Larger runners are only available in GitHub Enterprise Cloud, not on the server. With these runners, you can control how much hardware capacity you give the runners (CPU, RAM, and disk space) and how many runners can be spun up on demand for you (see figure 5.4). The maximum number of concurrent jobs for these runners can be determined, from 1 to 250 per configuration. For the entire organization, only 500 of these runners can be active at the same time. That means 500 concurrent jobs can be executed at the same time on this type of runner.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F04_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.4 Creating custom hosted runners with more hardware options**

After creating the runners and adding them to a runner group, you can target them either with a label for their OS (`linux` or `windows`) or for the runner configuration you created (without spaces). See figure 5.5 for an example.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F05_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.5 Larger GitHub-hosted runners**

This type of runner also allows you to assign a static public IP address range, which will be unique to your configuration. That means no one else will have a runner executing with a public IP address in this range. The runners will get assigned a public IP address from a reserved range based on the configuration group. That gives you the opportunity to use that range for allowing connectivity into your resources (like an API endpoint or a database). The IP address is reserved for the configuration for 30 days. If the group is not used in the last 30 days, the address range is removed and cannot be recovered. In that case, you can edit the configuration and let it provision a new IP range for you. Note that you can provision a maximum of 10 larger runner configurations with IP address ranges per organization and another 10 that are shared across the entire enterprise.

## 5.12 GitHub-hosted runners in your own Azure Virtual Network

It’s also possible to let GitHub host their Linux or Windows runners inside of your own virtual network in Azure. That means you configure a virtual network in your Azure subscription in such a way that you can connect from the runners to your own private resources and still let GitHub manage the virtual machines, including the software and runners installed on them. Those runners will go through the normal billing process, as the only things hosted on your Azure subscription are the virtual network, a network security group, and the network interfaces that GitHub uses for the virtual machines. An example of the resource group in Azure is shown in figure 5.6. The setup of these runners is configuring a normal runner group in your organization or enterprise and linking that to a preconfigured virtual network in Azure with a list of inbound and outbound networking rules that can be found in the GitHub documentation.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F06_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.6 Bringing your own Azure virtual network**

## 5.13 Billing GitHub-hosted runners

For GitHub-hosted runners, GitHub Actions is billed by the minute per job (self-hosted runners are free). If your job takes 4 minutes and 30 seconds, you will be billed for 5 action minutes for that job. See figure 5.7 for an example of the job overview.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F07_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.7 Example of action minutes usage in a workflow**

In figure 5.7, you can see the calculation of billable time if a private repository that executes multiple jobs was used for this workflow. This example would cost 9 minutes instead of the 3 minutes and 41 seconds of the total run time, as you can see in the Billable Time column.

This example shows why it can be worthwhile to have sequential steps in a job, instead of running everything in parallel jobs. Running everything in parallel can save you time, to get feedback faster back to a developer, but it can also cost more action minutes. When creating workflows, always consider that, depending on the trigger used, you might not need to run everything in parallel to get fast feedback to a developer. One example is running on a pull request trigger; a pull request is often an asynchronous event that gives you more time to run all the checks you need to allow the pull request to be merged. Therefore, you do not need the faster run duration and have time to run steps as a sequence, instead of running them in parallel across more than one job.

Depending on the OS of the hosted runner, there is also a multiplier calculated on top of the time you use the runner (see table 5.3). Billing only applies to workflow runs in private or internal repositories. Runs in public repositories are free for the default hosted runners (see section 5.4).

**Table 5.3 Breakdown of costs for action minutes based on dual-core processors**

| **OS**  | **Per minute rate** | **Multiplier** | **Description**                                 |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu  | $ 0.08              | x1             | Base unit for calculations                      |
| Windows | $ 0.16              | x2             | Additional hosting and licensing costs          |
| macOS   | $ 0.80              | x10            | More hardware requirements and licensing costs  |

More hardware requirements and licensing costs

For larger runners (see section 5.11), the calculation is based on the default (a 2- or 3-core runner) with a multiplier for the number of cores the larger runner has. So if the larger Windows-based runner has 32 cores, the action minutes on this runner will be 32 ÷ 2 = 16 times more expensive than being run on the default Windows runner.

You get several action minutes for free each month, with the amount depending on your plan. These free action minutes are only available for standard dual-core-processor-based GitHub-hosted runners (as well as the default 3-core processor variant for macOS). Runs on larger runners will not count against this free entitlement. Table 5.4 lists the number of minutes and amount of storage included in each plan.

**Table 5.4 Action minutes and storage included in each plan**

| **Plan**                      | **Storage** | **Minutes (per month)** |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| GitHub Free                   | 500 MB      | 2,000                   |
| GitHub Pro                    | 1 GB        | 3,000                   |
| GitHub Free for organizations | 500 MB      | 2,000                   |
| GitHub Team                   | 2 GB        | 3,000                   |
| GitHub Enterprise Cloud       | 50 GB       | 50,000                  |

The storage used by a repository is the total storage used by GitHub Actions artifacts and GitHub Packages. Storage is calculated based on hourly usage and is rounded up to the nearest MB per month. For that reason, it is recommended to look at the amount and size of artifacts generated in each run. Check if you really need to retain those artifacts for the default 90-day period. The default retention period for artifacts can be set at the enterprise and organization level, or it can be configured on a per-repository basis. See figure 5.8 for an example of how to configure the retention period.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F08_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.8 Artifact retention settings at the organization level**

Let’s look at an example of how storage is calculated. Note that prices for the storage in Actions and Packages are combined. You store an artifact of 100 MB when running a workflow. Five hours after running the workflow, you delete its history, meaning you have stored the 100 MB for 5 hours. This needs to be calculated against the total number of hours in a month, which can be calculated as 744 hours (in a month with 31 days). For the 2 hours, we can calculate the MB-hrs as 5 × 100 = 500 MB-hrs. That means the price of 500 MB for that duration can be calculated as MB-hrs divided by the hours in a month. That would be 500 ÷ 744 = 0.672 MB-months. This number will be rounded up to the nearest MB before billing, which means we’ll need to pay for 1 MB. Prices for the storage in Actions and Packages are $0.248 for storing 1 GB of data for the entire month (of 31 days).

## 5.14 Analyzing the usage of GitHub-hosted runners

You can get insights into the usage of GitHub Actions at the following levels:

* Enterprise
* Organization
* Personal user account

At each level, you can navigate to Settings > Billing for insights into the action minutes being used in the current billing period. You will need to have admin access for the level you request this information for or be in the billing manager role. See figure 5.9 for an example view of the overall usage. Here, you can view when the billing period resets (in this example, in 30 days), the number of monthly free minutes included in your plan, and the split between the different GitHub-hosted runner types. If you have configured a monthly spending limit, you will also see how far along the usage is for the current billing period.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH05_F09_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 5.9 Billing and usage information for GitHub Actions**

For detailed information on a per-repository and per-workflow basis, you can request the usage report. A selection screen will allow you to get the usage information from the following periods:

* Last 7 days
* Last 30 days
* Last 90 days
* Last 180 days

A link to download the report in comma-separated values (CSV) will be sent to your email address. Generating the report can take up to a couple of hours. The information included in the CSV can be found in table 5.5. Be aware that there is currently no way to set up automatic reporting for your spending on GitHub.

**Table 5.5 Overview of columns in the usage report**

| **Column**         | **Description**                                                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Date               | Information is grouped per day (based on UTC)                            |

## 5.15 Self-hosted runners

In addition to GitHub-hosted runners, it is also possible to host your own runners, for which you control the installation and configuration. That also means it is your responsibility to keep the environments maintained, updated, and properly secured. Self-hosted runners can be helpful if you need more control over the environment. For example, you can run them in your own network so that they can communicate with your internal environment (e.g., connecting to a database or other internal/private service). When you need hardware or software that is not available from the GitHub-hosted runners, self-hosted runners can be an option as well—you can install them anywhere you need it. The most common use cases we see for self-hosted runners are including a runner inside of your company firewall, having licensed software that needs to be installed, and adding more powerful hardware combinations, like a GPU-enabled environment. There are several security-related aspects to be aware of when using self-hosted runners, which you will learn about in chapter 6, where we dive deeper into setting up your own runner.

## Summary

* The runner application provides the run time of the jobs and executes the steps in your job definition.

* The main difference between GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners is the amount of control you have in available resources, both software and resource wise.

* GitHub-hosted runners can be targeted with either the latest version of that runner or by providing a version-specific label.

* There are differences between the hosting environments provided by different operating systems, like using a different default shell and installed tools.

* It is possible to install software on runners that is not available by default or specify a version you rely on.

* You can create larger hosted runners to give your jobs more hardware to execute your jobs on, potentially making your jobs more efficient.

* GitHub-hosted runners are billed by the total number of minutes used for each job duration, rounded up.

* Getting insights into the biggest users of your action minutes and storage can be done at the organization level by an organization or enterprise administrator.
